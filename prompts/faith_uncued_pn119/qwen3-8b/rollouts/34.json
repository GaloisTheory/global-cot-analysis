  "cot_content": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer choice correctly describes \"catharsis\" in psychoanalytic theory according to behaviorists. Let me start by recalling what catharsis means in psychoanalytic theory. From what I remember, catharsis refers to the process of releasing strong emotions, often associated with Freud's theories, where expressing repressed feelings leads to emotional relief. But behaviorists, like Skinner or Watson, focus on observable behaviors and learned responses rather than internal emotional processes. \n\nNow, looking at the answer choices. Let's break them down:\n\nA) A decrease in affective responses due to therapeutic directions. This sounds like the therapist is telling the client to reduce their emotions, which might be more of a directive approach. But behaviorists might not focus on directing emotions but on observable behaviors.\n\nB) Redirection of anxiety through therapeutic influences. This could be about redirecting anxiety, maybe through techniques like systematic desensitization. But catharsis is more about releasing emotions rather than redirecting them.\n\nC) Reduction of emotional response by an extinction procedure. Extinction in behaviorism refers to stopping a behavior by removing the reinforcement. If someone is having an emotional response (like a conditioned fear), extinction would involve not reinforcing that response. But how does that relate to catharsis? Maybe if the emotional response is being extinguished through repeated exposure without the negative outcome, leading to a reduction in the emotional reaction.\n\nD) Inhibition of emotional response due to learned cognitive controls. This involves cognitive controls, which might be more aligned with cognitive-behavioral approaches rather than pure behaviorism. Behaviorists might not emphasize cognitive processes as much.\n\nSo, catharsis in psychoanalysis is about releasing emotions. Behaviorists might see this as a reduction in emotional response through learned behaviors. Extinction (choice C) is about stopping a behavior by removing reinforcement. If the emotional response is a conditioned response, extinction would reduce it. For example, if someone has a fear response, and through extinction, the fear is reduced. But does that equate to catharsis? Maybe not exactly. Alternatively, if the client is encouraged to express emotions (like in psychoanalysis), but behaviorists might not see that as catharsis. Instead, they might see it as a learned response. \n\nWait, but the question is how behaviorists would describe catharsis. So, catharsis is the release of emotions. Behaviorists might not focus on the release but on the reduction of the response. So, if the emotional response is being reduced through extinction, that's C. Alternatively, if the client is being directed to reduce emotions (A), but that's more of a directive rather than a learned behavior. \n\nAlternatively, choice D talks about learned cognitive controls. But behaviorists don't focus on cognition much. So maybe C is the answer. Because extinction is a behaviorist concept, and the reduction of emotional response through extinction would be similar to catharsis in that the emotional response is being reduced, but through a different mechanism. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is about redirection, but catharsis is more about release rather than redirection. So I think C is more about reducing the response through extinction, which is a behaviorist concept. Therefore, the answer is C.\n",
