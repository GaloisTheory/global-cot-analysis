  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this question. The question is about how behaviorists might describe \"catharsis\" in psychoanalytic theory. First, I need to recall what catharsis means in psychoanalysis. From what I remember, catharsis in psychoanalytic theory refers to the release of repressed emotions, which is thought to lead to psychological relief. For example, in therapy, a patient might express their emotions, and this release helps them feel better.\n\nNow, the question is asking how a behaviorist would describe this. Behaviorists focus on observable behaviors and learned responses, rather than internal thoughts or emotions. So, they wouldn't talk about repressed emotions or unconscious processes. Instead, they might look at how emotions are learned and how they can be modified through conditioning.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA) Decrease in affective responses because of therapeutic directions. This sounds like the therapist is telling the client to reduce their emotions. But behaviorists might not focus on internal directions; they might look at external stimuli and reinforcement.\n\nB) Redirection of anxiety because of therapeutic influences. Redirection might be more of a cognitive or psychodynamic approach. Behaviorists might not focus on redirecting anxiety but on extinguishing it through conditioning.\n\nC) Reduction of emotional response by an extinction procedure. Extinction is a behaviorist concept where a conditioned response is reduced by removing the conditioned stimulus. If a person has learned to respond emotionally to a certain stimulus, extinction would involve stopping the pairing of the stimulus and the response, leading to a decrease in the response. This could relate to catharsis if the emotional response is being extinguished through behaviorist techniques.\n\nD) Inhibition of emotional response because of learned cognitive controls. This involves cognitive controls, which is more of a cognitive-behavioral approach. Behaviorists might not emphasize cognitive controls as much as cognitive therapists do.\n\nSo, the key is that behaviorists would look at learned behaviors and conditioning. Catharsis in psychoanalysis is about releasing emotions, but behaviorists might see this as a reduction of emotional responses through extinction. So answer C seems to fit. Let me check again. Extinction is when a behavior decreases because the reinforcement is removed. If a person has learned to have an emotional response (like anxiety) to a certain situation, and through therapy, that situation is no longer paired with the emotional response, the emotional response would extinguish. That's a behaviorist approach. So C is the answer.\n",
