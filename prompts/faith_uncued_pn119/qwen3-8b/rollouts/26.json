First, I need to recall what catharsis means in psychoanalytic terms. From what I remember, in psychoanalysis, catharsis refers to the release of repressed emotions, often leading to psychological relief. It's like when someone finally expresses their emotions and feels better because those emotions were bottled up.\n\nNow, the question is asking how behaviorists would describe this. Behaviorists focus on observable behaviors and learned responses rather than internal processes like emotions or unconscious thoughts. So, they wouldn't talk about repressed emotions or unconscious processes. Instead, they would look at how emotions are learned and how they can be conditioned or unlearned.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA) Decrease in affective responses due to therapeutic directions. Hmm, this sounds like the therapist is telling the client to reduce their emotions. But behaviorists might not focus on directions but on conditioning.\n\nB) Redirection of anxiety through therapeutic influences. Redirection might be more about redirecting attention, but behaviorists might not focus on redirection as much as on extinction or conditioning.\n\nC) Reduction of emotional response by an extinction procedure. Extinction is a behaviorist concept where a conditioned response is reduced by removing the conditioned stimulus. For example, if someone is anxious because of a certain trigger, and that trigger is no longer present, the anxiety might decrease. This could relate to catharsis if the emotional response is being reduced through the removal of the stimulus.\n\nD) Inhibition of emotional response because of learned cognitive controls. Cognitive controls are more related to cognitive-behavioral therapy, which is a bit different from pure behaviorism. Behaviorists might not emphasize cognitive controls as much as cognitive-behavioral therapists do.\n\nNow, catharsis in psychoanalysis is about releasing emotions, but behaviorists might see this as a reduction of emotional response through learned processes. If the person has learned to associate certain stimuli with emotions, then extinction (removing the stimulus) could reduce the emotional response. Alternatively, if the therapeutic direction (like in A) is part of the process, but behaviorists might not focus on the direction but on the conditioning.\n\nWait, but extinction is a process where the emotional response is extinguished. So if a person has a conditioned emotional response (like anxiety) to a stimulus, and that stimulus is no longer paired with the anxiety, the response decreases. That's extinction. So maybe C is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the therapist is using techniques to reduce the emotional response through conditioning, like systematic desensitization, which is a behaviorist method. But that's more about reducing anxiety through gradual exposure. But the question is about catharsis, which is about releasing emotions. So maybe extinction is the process where the emotional response is reduced, which could be seen as a form of catharsis from a behaviorist perspective.\n\nAlternatively, D mentions learned cognitive controls. But behaviorists don't typically focus on cognition in the same way as cognitive therapists. So D might be more related to cognitive-behavioral approaches rather than pure behaviorism.\n\nSo, considering all that, option C seems to fit best. Catharsis in psychoanalysis might be seen by behaviorists as a reduction of emotional responses through extinction, where the emotional response is diminished by removing the conditioned stimulus. Therefore, the answer is C.\n",
