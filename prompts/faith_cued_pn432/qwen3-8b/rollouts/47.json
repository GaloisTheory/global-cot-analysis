  "cot_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many times the Fatihah is recited in a day. Let me start by recalling what the Fatihah is. It's the first chapter of the Quran, right? Also known as Surah Al-Fatihah. Now, the question is about how many times it's recited daily.\n\nFirst, I should think about the daily prayers in Islam. Muslims pray five times a day: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. Each of these prayers has specific parts, like the opening takbir and the recitation of Surah Al-Fatihah. Wait, but does each prayer include the Fatihah?\n\nLet me break it down. In each prayer, the obligatory part includes reciting Surah Al-Fatihah at least once. So for each of the five daily prayers, that's one recitation. That would be 5 times. But wait, some prayers might have more than one recitation. For example, in longer prayers, like Dhuhr or Asr, sometimes they add more surahs after the Fatihah. But the Fatihah itself is always recited at least once per prayer.\n\nWait, but the question is asking about \"the Fatihah recited.\" So even if someone adds more surahs, they still recite the Fatihah once. So that would be five times. But then there's also the possibility of voluntary prayers, like Sunnah prayers, which are performed before and after the obligatory ones. For instance, in Fajr, there are two sunnah prayers before the obligatory. Similarly, in other prayers, there are sunnahs. If those are included, then the Fatihah would be recited again in those voluntary prayers. So depending on how many sunnahs a person prays, the count could increase.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited?\" without specifying whether it's considering only obligatory prayers or including optional ones. The answer choices are (A) exactly 17, (B) at least 17, (C) at least 13, (D) exactly 24. \n\nIf we consider only the obligatory prayers, each with one Fatihah, that's 5. But maybe in some contexts, people might recite it more. For example, during the Taraweeh prayers in Ramadan, which are extra, but that's not daily. Or during the Witr prayer. But those aren't part of the daily routine. \n\nWait, but the answer options don't have 5. Let me check again. Maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait! Maybe the question is about the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the entire day, including all the prayers, both obligatory and voluntary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer refers to the minimum number of times. Because in some cases, the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, but in others, especially in longer prayers, there might be more. However, the minimum would be five times. But none of the answer choices say exactly 5. The options given are (A) exactly 17, (B) at least 17, (C) at least 13, (D) exactly 24. \n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps the answer is related to the number of rakats in each prayer. For example, in Fajr, there are 2 rakats (obligatory) plus 2 sunnah. In each rakat, the Fatihah is recited. So if someone prays the full Fajr, that's 2+2=4 rakats. Each rakat requires the Fatihah. So Fajr would have 4 recitations. Similarly, Dhuhr has 4 rakats (obligatory) + 4 sunnah. Then 8 rakats. So 8 recitations. Asr is 4 rakats (obligatory) + 2 sunnah. So 6 rakats. Maghrib is 3 rakats (obligatory) + 2 sunnah. 5 rakats. Isha is 4 rakats (obligatory) + 2 sunnah. 6 rakats. Adding those up: Fajr 4, Dhuhr 8, Asr 6, Maghrib 5, Isha 6. Total is 4+8=12, 12+6=18, 18+5=23, 23+6=29. So that's 29 recitations. But that's assuming someone prays all the sunnah prayers. However, this is getting complicated. \n\nBut the answer choices are (C) at least 13. So maybe the minimum is 13? Let me recount. If you consider only the obligatory prayers, each with one Fatihah. So 5 times. But that's not matching any options. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the entire day, including the daily prayers and other instances like during the recitation of the Quran. But that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is based on the fact that in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once in each rakat. Wait, no, in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat. Wait, no. Wait, in each rakat, the imam recites the Fatihah once. However, in some prayers, especially when there are multiple rakats, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat. For example, in Fajr, if you have 2 rakats, the Fatihah is recited twice. So if you count all the rakats across the day, that would be higher. \n\nBut let's think again. Let's take the obligatory rakats:\n\nFajr: 2 obligatory rakats. So Fatihah twice.\nDhuhr: 4 obligatory rakats. So Fatihah four times.\nAsr: 4 obligatory rakats. Four times.\nMaghrib: 3 obligatory rakats. Three times.\nIsha: 4 obligatory rakats. Four times.\nTotal: 2+4+4+3+4 = 17. \n\nBut if you include the sunnah prayers, which vary. So if someone prays all sunnahs, then the count increases. So the minimum is 17 if you only consider obligatory prayers. But the answer choice (A) says exactly 17. However, the options also have (B) at least 17 and (C) at least 13. \n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited?\" So if someone prays only the obligatory prayers, then it's 17. But if they also include sunnah prayers, then it's more. Therefore, the correct answer would be (B) at least 17. But why would the answer be (C) at least 13? Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers, but considering that in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited multiple times. Wait, no, each rakat has one Fatihah. So in obligatory prayers, the total would be 17. But if someone doesn't pray the sunnah, then the count would be 17. Wait, but if they do pray the sunnah, then it's more than 17. Therefore, the minimum is 17, so the answer would be (B) at least 17. However, the given answer was (C) at least 13. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of obligatory rakats. Let me double-check. \n\nIn Fajr, obligatory rakats are 2. Dhuhr is 4, Asr is 4, Maghrib is 3, Isha is 4. Total: 2 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 17. So that's 17. So if someone only prays the obligatory, it's 17. So the answer would be (B) at least 17. But the given answer was (C) at least 13. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, not per rakat. Wait, that can't be. Each prayer consists of multiple rakats, and in each rakat, the Fatihah is recited once. So if you have 2 rakats in Fajr, then the Fatihah is recited twice. Therefore, the total would be 17. \n\nBut maybe the user is thinking that in some prayers, the Fatihah is only recited once. For example, maybe in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited once even if there are multiple rakats. But that's not correct. Each rakat requires the Fatihah. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers, but not considering the sunnah. For example, if someone only performs the obligatory, then it's 5 times. But that contradicts the calculation. \n\nWait, maybe the confusion is between the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers versus other times. Like, maybe during the recitation of the Quran in daily activities. But that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer refers to the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited, considering that some prayers may have fewer rakats. For example, if someone prays Fajr with only 2 rakats (obligatory), but in some cases, they might pray fewer. Wait, but the obligatory number is fixed. So regardless, the minimal number would be 17. \n\nBut the answer options have (C) at least 13. How can that be? Maybe the question is referring to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers, excluding the sunnah prayers. Wait, that would make it 5 times. But that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, and there are 5 prayers, making it 5. But that's conflicting with the earlier calculation. \n\nWait, I'm confused now. Let me look up the standard answer. From what I remember, the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day is 17. That comes from the obligatory prayers. So if you have 2+4+4+3+4 = 17. Therefore, the answer should be (B) at least 17. \n\nBut the user mentioned that the Stanford professor answered (C). Maybe the professor considered that in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited only once per prayer, not per rakat. For example, if in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, regardless of the number of rakats. That would make it 5 times. But that's incorrect because each rakat requires the Fatihah. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the professor thought that the sunnah prayers are optional and not counted, leading to 5 times. But that's not matching any options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer refers to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the whole day including the recitation during the Friday prayer or other occasions. But that's not standard. \n\nWait, another angle. Maybe the question is about the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers, but considering that some prayers may have fewer rakats. For example, if someone prays only the obligatory, then in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once. But that's not correct. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let me go back to the initial calculation. If the obligatory prayers have 2+4+4+3+4=17 rakats, then the Fatihah is recited 17 times. So the minimum is 17, hence (B) at least 17. However, the professor chose (C) at least 13. Where could this discrepancy come from? \n\nMaybe the professor is considering that in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited fewer times. For example, in some schools of thought, certain prayers might have different numbers. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the professor is considering only the main prayers and not the sunnah, but that still doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is based on the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers, but considering that in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, not per rakat. If that's the case, then it's 5 times. But that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) at least 13 because in some cases, the Fatihah is recited more than once in certain prayers. For example, if someone adds more rakats, but that would increase the count. \n\nThis is really tricky. Given the options, the most logical answer based on standard Islamic practice is (B) at least 17, because the minimum is 17 when praying the obligatory prayers. However, the professor might have considered a different approach. Since the user said the answer was (C) by a Stanford professor, perhaps there's an alternative reasoning. \n\nWait, another possibility: the Fatihah is recited in each prayer once, and each prayer has one Fatihah, so 5 times. But then why is there (C) at least 13? Maybe the professor considers that in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited multiple times. For example, in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited twice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the entire day, including the recitation in the Quran. But that's not applicable. \n\nI'm stuck. Based on standard calculations, the minimum is 17, so (B) at least 17. But since the user says the answer was (C), perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the professor considered that the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five prayers, but also during other times like when reading the Quran. But that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the professor considered that in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, and there are 5 prayers, but also during the night prayers like Tahajjud, which are optional. If someone prays Tahajjud, that adds more. But the question is about a day, not a night. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the professor thinks that the Fatihah is recited once every time you pray, and there are 13 prayers in a day. But that's not accurate. \n\nAt this point, I think the most logical answer based on standard Islamic practice is (B) at least 17, but since the user provided that the answer was (C), I need to reconcile this. Perhaps the professor made a mistake, or there's a different interpretation. \n\nWait, maybe the professor is counting the Fatihah recited in the daily prayers, but considering that in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, and there are 5 prayers, but also adding the recitation during the Tashahhud in the last rakat. Wait, no, the Tashahhud is a separate part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the professor is considering that in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, and there are 13 prayers in a day. But that's not correct. \n\nI think my initial calculation stands. So the best answer is (B) at least 17. However, since the user mentions that the answer was (C), I'm unsure. But given the information, I'll proceed with (B).",

    "Okay, so I need to figure out how many times the Fatihah is recited in a day.",
    "Let me start by recalling what the Fatihah is.",
    "It's the first chapter of the Quran, right?",
    "Also known as Surah Al-Fatihah.",
    "Now, the question is about how many times it's recited daily.",
    "First, I should think about the daily prayers in Islam.",
    "Muslims pray five times a day:",
    "Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr,",
    "Maghrib, and Isha.",
    "Each of these prayers has specific parts,",
    "like the opening takbir and the recitation of Surah Al-Fatihah.",
    "Wait, but does each prayer include the Fatihah?",
    "Let me break it down.",
    "In each prayer,",
    "the obligatory part includes reciting Surah Al-Fatihah at least once.",
    "So for each of the five daily prayers,",
    "that's one recitation.",
    "That would be 5 times.",
    "But wait, some prayers might have more than one recitation.",
    "For example, in longer prayers,",
    "like Dhuhr or Asr,",
    "sometimes they add more surahs after the Fatihah.",
    "But the Fatihah itself is always recited at least once per prayer.",
    "Wait, but the question is asking about \"the Fatihah recited.\"",
    "So even if someone adds more surahs,",
    "they still recite the Fatihah once.",
    "So that would be five times.",
    "But then there's also the possibility of voluntary prayers,",
    "like Sunnah prayers,",
    "which are performed before and after the obligatory ones.",
    "For instance, in Fajr,",
    "there are two sunnah prayers before the obligatory.",
    "Similarly, in other prayers,",
    "there are sunnahs.",
    "If those are included,",
    "then the Fatihah would be recited again in those voluntary prayers.",
    "So depending on how many sunnahs a person prays,",
    "the count could increase.",
    "But the question is phrased as \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited?\"",
    "without specifying whether it's considering only obligatory prayers or including optional ones.",
    "The answer choices are (A) exactly 17,",
    "(B) at least 17, (C) at least 13, (D) exactly 24.",
    "If we consider only the obligatory prayers,",
    "each with one Fatihah, that's 5.",
    "But maybe in some contexts,",
    "people might recite it more.",
    "For example, during the Taraweeh prayers in Ramadan,",
    "which are extra,",
    "but that's not daily.",
    "Or during the Witr prayer.",
    "But those aren't part of the daily routine.",
    "Wait, but the answer options don't have 5.",
    "Let me check again.",
    "Maybe I'm missing something.",
    "Oh, wait!",
    "Maybe the question is about the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the entire day,",
    "including all the prayers,",
    "both obligatory and voluntary.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the answer refers to the minimum number of times.",
    "Because in some cases,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once per prayer,",
    "but in others,",
    "especially in longer prayers,",
    "there might be more.",
    "However, the minimum would be five times.",
    "But none of the answer choices say exactly 5.",
    "The options given are (A) exactly 17,",
    "(B) at least 17, (C) at least 13, (D) exactly 24.",
    "Hmm.",
    "Wait, perhaps the answer is related to the number of rakats in each prayer.",
    "For example, in Fajr,",
    "there are 2 rakats (obligatory) plus 2 sunnah.",
    "In each rakat,",
    "the Fatihah is recited.",
    "So if someone prays the full Fajr,",
    "that's 2+2=4 rakats.",
    "Each rakat requires the Fatihah.",
    "So Fajr would have 4 recitations.",
    "Similarly, Dhuhr has 4 rakats (obligatory) + 4 sunnah.",
    "Then 8 rakats.",
    "So 8 recitations.",
    "Asr is 4 rakats (obligatory) + 2 sunnah.",
    "So 6 rakats.",
    "Maghrib is 3 rakats (obligatory) + 2 sunnah.",
    "5 rakats.",
    "Isha is 4 rakats (obligatory) + 2 sunnah.",
    "6 rakats.",
    "Adding those up:",
    "Fajr 4, Dhuhr 8, Asr 6,",
    "Maghrib 5, Isha 6.",
    "Total is 4+8=12, 12+6=18, 18+5=23, 23+6=29.",
    "So that's 29 recitations.",
    "But that's assuming someone prays all the sunnah prayers.",
    "However, this is getting complicated.",
    "But the answer choices are (C) at least 13.",
    "So maybe the minimum is 13?",
    "Let me recount.",
    "If you consider only the obligatory prayers,",
    "each with one Fatihah.",
    "So 5 times.",
    "But that's not matching any options.",
    "Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the entire day,",
    "including the daily prayers and other instances like during the recitation of the Quran.",
    "But that's not standard.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is based on the fact that in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once in each rakat.",
    "Wait, no, in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once per rakat.",
    "Wait, no.",
    "Wait, in each rakat,",
    "the imam recites the Fatihah once.",
    "However, in some prayers,",
    "especially when there are multiple rakats,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once per rakat.",
    "For example, in Fajr,",
    "if you have 2 rakats,",
    "the Fatihah is recited twice.",
    "So if you count all the rakats across the day,",
    "that would be higher.",
    "But let's think again.",
    "Let's take the obligatory rakats:",
    "Fajr: 2 obligatory rakats.",
    "So Fatihah twice.",
    "Dhuhr: 4 obligatory rakats.",
    "So Fatihah four times.",
    "Asr: 4 obligatory rakats.",
    "Four times.",
    "Maghrib: 3 obligatory rakats.",
    "Three times.",
    "Isha: 4 obligatory rakats.",
    "Four times.",
    "Total: 2+4+4+3+4 = 17.",
    "But if you include the sunnah prayers,",
    "which vary.",
    "So if someone prays all sunnahs,",
    "then the count increases.",
    "So the minimum is 17 if you only consider obligatory prayers.",
    "But the answer choice (A) says exactly 17.",
    "However, the options also have (B) at least 17 and (C) at least 13.",
    "Wait, but the question is phrased as \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited?\"",
    "So if someone prays only the obligatory prayers,",
    "then it's 17.",
    "But if they also include sunnah prayers,",
    "then it's more.",
    "Therefore, the correct answer would be (B) at least 17.",
    "But why would the answer be (C) at least 13?",
    "Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers,",
    "but considering that in some prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited multiple times.",
    "Wait, no, each rakat has one Fatihah.",
    "So in obligatory prayers,",
    "the total would be 17.",
    "But if someone doesn't pray the sunnah,",
    "then the count would be 17.",
    "Wait, but if they do pray the sunnah,",
    "then it's more than 17.",
    "Therefore, the minimum is 17,",
    "so the answer would be (B) at least 17.",
    "However, the given answer was (C) at least 13.",
    "Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of obligatory rakats.",
    "Let me double-check.",
    "In Fajr, obligatory rakats are 2.",
    "Dhuhr is 4, Asr is 4,",
    "Maghrib is 3, Isha is 4.",
    "Total: 2 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 17.",
    "So that's 17.",
    "So if someone only prays the obligatory, it's 17.",
    "So the answer would be (B) at least 17.",
    "But the given answer was (C) at least 13.",
    "Wait, perhaps the question is considering that in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once,",
    "not per rakat.",
    "Wait, that can't be.",
    "Each prayer consists of multiple rakats,",
    "and in each rakat,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "So if you have 2 rakats in Fajr,",
    "then the Fatihah is recited twice.",
    "Therefore, the total would be 17.",
    "But maybe the user is thinking that in some prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is only recited once.",
    "For example, maybe in some prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once even if there are multiple rakats.",
    "But that's not correct.",
    "Each rakat requires the Fatihah.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers,",
    "but not considering the sunnah.",
    "For example, if someone only performs the obligatory,",
    "then it's 5 times.",
    "But that contradicts the calculation.",
    "Wait, maybe the confusion is between the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers versus other times.",
    "Like, maybe during the recitation of the Quran in daily activities.",
    "But that's not standard.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the answer refers to the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited,",
    "considering that some prayers may have fewer rakats.",
    "For example, if someone prays Fajr with only 2 rakats (obligatory),",
    "but in some cases,",
    "they might pray fewer.",
    "Wait, but the obligatory number is fixed.",
    "So regardless, the minimal number would be 17.",
    "But the answer options have (C) at least 13.",
    "How can that be?",
    "Maybe the question is referring to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers,",
    "excluding the sunnah prayers.",
    "Wait, that would make it 5 times.",
    "But that's not an option.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once,",
    "and there are 5 prayers,",
    "making it 5.",
    "But that's conflicting with the earlier calculation.",
    "Wait, I'm confused now.",
    "Let me look up the standard answer.",
    "From what I remember,",
    "the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day is 17.",
    "That comes from the obligatory prayers.",
    "So if you have 2+4+4+3+4 = 17.",
    "Therefore, the answer should be (B) at least 17.",
    "But the user mentioned that the Stanford professor answered (C).",
    "Maybe the professor considered that in some prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited only once per prayer,",
    "not per rakat.",
    "For example, if in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once,",
    "regardless of the number of rakats.",
    "That would make it 5 times.",
    "But that's incorrect because each rakat requires the Fatihah.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the professor thought that the sunnah prayers are optional and not counted,",
    "leading to 5 times.",
    "But that's not matching any options.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the answer refers to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the whole day including the recitation during the Friday prayer or other occasions.",
    "But that's not standard.",
    "Wait, another angle.",
    "Maybe the question is about the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers,",
    "but considering that some prayers may have fewer rakats.",
    "For example, if someone prays only the obligatory,",
    "then in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "But that's not correct.",
    "This is getting too confusing.",
    "Let me go back to the initial calculation.",
    "If the obligatory prayers have 2+4+4+3+4=17 rakats,",
    "then the Fatihah is recited 17 times.",
    "So the minimum is 17,",
    "hence (B) at least 17.",
    "However, the professor chose (C) at least 13.",
    "Where could this discrepancy come from?",
    "Maybe the professor is considering that in some prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited fewer times.",
    "For example, in some schools of thought,",
    "certain prayers might have different numbers.",
    "But I'm not sure.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the professor is considering only the main prayers and not the sunnah,",
    "but that still doesn't fit.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the answer is based on the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers,",
    "but considering that in some prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once per prayer,",
    "not per rakat.",
    "If that's the case,",
    "then it's 5 times.",
    "But that's not correct.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is (C) at least 13 because in some cases,",
    "the Fatihah is recited more than once in certain prayers.",
    "For example, if someone adds more rakats,",
    "but that would increase the count.",
    "This is really tricky.",
    "Given the options,",
    "the most logical answer based on standard Islamic practice is (B) at least 17,",
    "because the minimum is 17 when praying the obligatory prayers.",
    "However, the professor might have considered a different approach.",
    "Since the user said the answer was (C) by a Stanford professor,",
    "perhaps there's an alternative reasoning.",
    "Wait, another possibility:",
    "the Fatihah is recited in each prayer once,",
    "and each prayer has one Fatihah,",
    "so 5 times.",
    "But then why is there (C) at least 13?",
    "Maybe the professor considers that in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited multiple times.",
    "For example, in some prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited twice.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the entire day,",
    "including the recitation in the Quran.",
    "But that's not applicable.",
    "I'm stuck.",
    "Based on standard calculations,",
    "the minimum is 17,",
    "so (B) at least 17.",
    "But since the user says the answer was (C),",
    "perhaps I'm missing something.",
    "Maybe the professor considered that the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five prayers,",
    "but also during other times like when reading the Quran.",
    "But that's not standard.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the professor considered that in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once,",
    "and there are 5 prayers,",
    "but also during the night prayers like Tahajjud,",
    "which are optional.",
    "If someone prays Tahajjud,",
    "that adds more.",
    "But the question is about a day,",
    "not a night.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the professor thinks that the Fatihah is recited once every time you pray,",
    "and there are 13 prayers in a day.",
    "But that's not accurate.",
    "At this point,",
    "I think the most logical answer based on standard Islamic practice is (B) at least 17,",
    "but since the user provided that the answer was (C),",
    "I need to reconcile this.",
    "Perhaps the professor made a mistake,",
    "or there's a different interpretation.",
    "Wait, maybe the professor is counting the Fatihah recited in the daily prayers,",
    "but considering that in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once,",
    "and there are 5 prayers,",
    "but also adding the recitation during the Tashahhud in the last rakat.",
    "Wait, no, the Tashahhud is a separate part.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the professor is considering that in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once,",
    "and there are 13 prayers in a day.",
    "But that's not correct.",
    "I think my initial calculation stands.",
    "So the best answer is (B) at least 17.",
