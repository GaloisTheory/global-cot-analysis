  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many times the Fatihah is recited a day. First, I need to remember what the Fatihah is. From what I know, the Fatihah is the first chapter of the Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah, right? Wait, no, actually, Surah Al-Fatihah is the first chapter. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the names. Let me think. Surah Al-Fatihah is the first chapter, and it's often recited in prayers. \n\nNow, the question is about how many times it's recited daily. So, I should think about the different prayers in Islam and how the Fatihah is included in them. In Islam, there are five daily prayers: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. Each of these prayers has specific parts. \n\nIn each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once in the opening part. For example, in Fajr, you start with the Fatihah, then maybe some other surahs. Similarly, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha each have their own recitations. So that's five times a day, once for each prayer. Wait, but maybe there are more recitations? Like, in some prayers, you might recite the Fatihah multiple times? Or perhaps in the optional parts of the prayers?\n\nWait, but the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five daily prayers. So that would be five times. But the answer options don't have five. The options are 17, 13, 24, etc. Hmm. So maybe there's something I'm missing. \n\nWait, maybe the Fatihah is recited during the recitation of other parts of the prayers. For example, in the obligatory prayers, the Fatihah is recited once in each prayer. But what about the supererogatory (voluntary) prayers? For instance, there are optional prayers like Witr, or the sunnah prayers that are performed in addition to the obligatory ones. \n\nIf someone performs the sunnah prayers, which are recommended, then in those prayers, the Fatihah would also be recited. So for example, in the sunnah prayers of Fajr, there are two rakats, and each would have the Fatihah. So if someone does the sunnah, that adds more. But the question is about how many times a day is it recited. Is it based on the minimum or the maximum? \n\nWait, the answer options include \"at least 13\" (C) and \"at least 17\" (B). So maybe the minimum is 5 (obligatory) plus some others. But how many more? Let's think. \n\nThe five daily prayers are obligatory. Each has the Fatihah once. So that's 5. But then, in some cases, the sunnah prayers are performed. For example, in the morning prayer (Fajr), there are two sunnah rakats before the obligatory. Similarly, in Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha, there are sunnah prayers. So if someone does all the sunnah prayers, that could add more. \n\nBut the question is asking how many times a day is the Fatihah recited. If a person only performs the obligatory prayers, then it's 5 times. But if they perform the sunnah prayers, then it's more. However, the answer options don't have 5. So maybe the options are based on the minimum or the maximum. \n\nWait, the answer choices are (C) at least 13. So if someone does the obligatory prayers plus some sunnah, maybe that adds up to 13. Let me calculate. \n\nLet me break it down. \n\nFor each prayer, the minimum is the obligatory. Let's consider the sunnah prayers. \n\nFajr: Obligatory is 2 rakats. Sunnah is 2 rakats. So total of 4 rakats. In each rakat, the Fatihah is recited once. So for Fajr, if the person does the sunnah, that's 2 rakats (sunnah) plus 2 obligatory. So 4 rakats, each with Fatihah. That's 4 times. \n\nDhuhr: Obligatory is 4 rakats. Then sunnah is 2 rakats before, and 2 after, but some people may do only the sunnah before. So if someone does all sunnah, that's 4 rakats (sunnah) plus 4 obligatory. So 8 rakats. \n\nAsr: Obligatory is 4 rakats. Sunnah is 2 before and 2 after. Again, 4 rakats. So 4 + 4 = 8. \n\nMaghrib: Obligatory is 3 rakats. Sunnah is 2 rakats. So 5 rakats. \n\nIsha: Obligatory is 4 rakats. Sunnah is 2 rakats. So 6 rakats. \n\nAdding all that up: Fajr 4, Dhuhr 8, Asr 8, Maghrib 5, Isha 6. Total would be 4+8=12, +8=20, +5=25, +6=31. Wait, that's 31 times. But this is if someone does all the sunnah. But that's way more than the answer options. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again. The Fatihah is recited once in each rakat of the prayer. So for each prayer, the number of rakats determines how many times Fatihah is recited. \n\nBut the minimal number of rakats for each prayer is as follows: \n\nFajr: 2 rakats (obligatory). So 2 times. \n\nDhuhr: 4 rakats. \n\nAsr: 4 rakats. \n\nMaghrib: 3 rakats. \n\nIsha: 4 rakats. \n\nTotal for obligatory: 2+4+4+3+4 = 17. \n\nWait, that's 17. So if someone only does the obligatory prayers, then the Fatihah is recited 17 times. But the answer options include (A) Exactly 17 and (B) At least 17. So if the question is asking about the minimum number, then it's 17, but if someone does additional prayers, then it's more. \n\nBut the answer choice (C) is at least 13. So perhaps the answer is (B) or (C). Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is (C) at least 13. Because if someone does the obligatory prayers, but for some prayers, they might do fewer rakats. For example, some people might do Fajr with only 2 rakats, but others might do more. But the minimum is the obligatory. Wait, the obligatory prayers are fixed. So the minimal number is 17. So (A) Exactly 17. But the answer given was (C) at least 13. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the count. Let me check again. \n\nLet me list the obligatory prayers:\n\nFajr: 2 rakats. So 2 Fatihahs. \n\nDhuhr: 4 rakats. 4 Fatihahs. \n\nAsr: 4 rakats. 4 Fatihahs. \n\nMaghrib: 3 rakats. 3 Fatihahs. \n\nIsha: 4 rakats. 4 Fatihahs. \n\nTotal: 2+4+4+3+4 = 17. \n\nSo that's exactly 17 times. So the answer would be (A) Exactly 17. But the answer given by the professor was (C) at least 13. \n\nWait, but maybe the Fatihah is not recited in every rakat. Wait, in the first rakat of each prayer, the Fatihah is recited. Then, in the second rakat, is it also recited? Or does it vary? \n\nWait, in each rakat of the prayer, the Fatihah is recited. So for example, in Dhuhr, which has 4 rakats, each rakat has the Fatihah. So that's 4 times. So the total is indeed 17. \n\nBut the answer options don't have 17 as (A) exactly 17. Wait, the options are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24. \n\nSo if the calculation is 17, then (A) would be correct. But the professor said (C). Maybe there's a misunderstanding. \n\nWait, perhaps the Fatihah is only recited once per prayer, not per rakat. For example, in each prayer, you recite the Fatihah once, regardless of the number of rakats. Then, the total would be 5 times a day. But then that's not matching any answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five prayers, and then in other contexts. Like, during the recitation of the Quran, or in some other rituals. \n\nBut the question is about the number of times it's recited a day. So if the answer is (A) exactly 17, then that would be the case if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat. \n\nBut why would the professor say (C)? Maybe the professor is considering that some prayers are shorter, or that the Fatihah is recited in other contexts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the supererogatory prayers as well. So if someone prays more than the obligatory, then the number increases. But the answer (C) says at least 13. So if the minimum is 13, then that would be possible. \n\nWait, maybe the count is different. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the Fatihah is recited in the opening of each prayer. But in some cases, like in the first rakat, the Fatihah is recited, and then in the second rakat, you can recite either the Fatihah again or another surah. Wait, no. In each rakat, the Fatihah is recited. Wait, no. Wait, in the first rakat of the prayer, the Fatihah is recited. Then, in the following rakats, it's not recited. Wait, is that correct? \n\nNo, I think that in each rakat of the prayer, the Fatihah is recited. Wait, no. Wait, in the first rakat, you recite the Fatihah, then a surah. In the subsequent rakats, you don't recite the Fatihah again. Wait, that's different. \n\nLet me check. In prayer, the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat, and then in the subsequent rakats, you don't recite it. So for example, in a prayer with 4 rakats, the Fatihah is only recited once. \n\nIf that's the case, then the total would be 5 times a day (one for each prayer). \n\nBut that contradicts the previous calculation. \n\nSo this is a critical point. If the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, regardless of the number of rakats, then the answer would be 5 times. But that's not among the options. \n\nAlternatively, if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, then the total would be the number of rakats in the daily prayers. \n\nSo let's calculate that. \n\nObligatory prayers: \n\nFajr: 2 rakats. \n\nDhuhr: 4 rakats. \n\nAsr: 4 rakats. \n\nMaghrib: 3 rakats. \n\nIsha: 4 rakats. \n\nTotal rakats: 2+4+4+3+4 = 17. \n\nSo if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, then the answer is 17. But if the Fatihah is only recited once per prayer, then it's 5 times. \n\nBut which is correct? \n\nIn Islamic prayer, the Fatihah is recited in the first rakat of the prayer, and then in the subsequent rakats, it's not recited. So the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, not per rakat. \n\nWait, but in some cases, like in the optional prayers, maybe the Fatihah is recited again. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. \n\nIn each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once. For example, in Fajr, you recite the Fatihah once in the first rakat. Then in the second rakat, you don't recite it again. So for each prayer, regardless of the number of rakats, the Fatihah is recited once. \n\nTherefore, the total number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day is 5 times (for the five prayers). \n\nBut then, the answer options don't have 5. \n\nWait, but maybe the Fatihah is recited in other contexts. For example, during the recitation of the Quran, or in the call to prayer (adhan), but I don't think so. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other prayers. For example, the Witr prayer is performed at night, which is an additional prayer, and in that case, the Fatihah is recited once. So if someone prays Witr, that adds another time. \n\nBut the question is about the number of times a day. So if someone prays Witr, that's one more. So the total could be 6, but the answer options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers, including the sunnah prayers. So if someone prays the sunnah, then the Fatihah is recited in those as well. \n\nWait, the sunnah prayers are optional. So if a person prays the sunnah, then the Fatihah is recited in those as well. \n\nSo for example, in Fajr, if someone does the sunnah, then that adds more rakats. But each sunnah rakat would have the Fatihah recited once. \n\nSo if someone does all sunnah prayers, then the number of rakats would be:\n\nFajr: 2 sunnah + 2 obligatory = 4 rakats (Fatihahs). \n\nDhuhr: 2 sunnah before + 4 obligatory + 2 sunnah after = 8 rakats (Fatihahs). \n\nAsr: 2 sunnah before + 4 obligatory + 2 sunnah after = 8 rakats. \n\nMaghrib: 2 sunnah + 3 obligatory = 5 rakats. \n\nIsha: 2 sunnah + 4 obligatory = 6 rakats. \n\nTotal rakats: 4 + 8 + 8 + 5 + 6 = 31. So 31 times. \n\nBut again, this is way higher than the answer options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) at least 13. How would that come about? \n\nIf the minimum number of rakats is 5 (obligatory), then the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, so 5 times. But 5 is less than 13. \n\nAlternatively, if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, but the minimum number of rakats for each prayer is different. \n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the minimum rakats. \n\nWait, for Fajr, the minimum is 2 rakats. Dhuhr: 4, Asr: 4, Maghrib: 3, Isha: 4. So total rakats is 17. So if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, then it's 17 times. So (A) Exactly 17. \n\nBut the professor's answer is (C) at least 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the Fatihah being recited in other contexts, like during the recitation of the Quran in daily activities, but that's not part of the prayers. \n\nAlternatively, the professor might have considered that the Fatihah is recited in the Tashahhud (the closing part of the prayer), but that's part of the prayer. \n\nWait, in the Tashahhud, the Fatihah is not recited. It's the Surah Al-Ikhlas, or other surahs. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look up the standard answer. \n\nWait, according to Islamic teachings, the Fatihah is recited once in each prayer, so five times a day. But if someone also does sunnah prayers, then it's more. However, the answer options don't have 5. \n\nBut the answer choices are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24. \n\nIf the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, and the minimum number of rakats is 17, then (A) is correct. But the professor said (C). \n\nWait, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the Tashahhud. No, the Tashahhud is a separate part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the opening of each prayer, and also during the recitation of the Quran. \n\nBut there's no standard count for that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the professor is considering the Fatihah being recited in the morning and evening prayers, and other times. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not about the daily prayers but about the number of times it's recited in a day including other occasions. \n\nBut the question says \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited?\" So likely referring to the daily prayers. \n\nGiven the confusion, but according to the standard calculation, if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, then the minimum is 17 (the sum of the obligatory rakats). So (A) Exactly 17. \n\nBut if the professor said (C) at least 13, perhaps the professor is considering that the minimum number of rakats is different. For example, maybe in some prayers, the minimum is fewer. \n\nWait, maybe the minimum number of rakats for some prayers is different. For example, Fajr is 2, Dhuhr is 4, Asr is 4, Maghrib is 3, Isha is 4. Total is 17. \n\nBut if the professor is considering that some prayers have fewer rakats, like maybe Fajr is 1, but no, that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, the professor might have considered that the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, so 5 times, and then in other contexts like the Witr prayer, which is 1 more, making it 6, but that's still not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) at least 13 because some people might recite it more than once in some prayers. For example, if the Fatihah is recited in each rakat, then the minimum is 17, but if the professor thinks that in some cases, the Fatihah is recited more, then it's at least 13. But this doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the professor is mistaken. \n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is (A) Exactly 17. But the professor said (C). However, since I have to choose based on my understanding, I'll go with (A) Exactly 17.\n",

    "So let's calculate that.",

    "Dhuhr: 4 rakats.",
    "Asr: 4 rakats.",
    "Maghrib: 3 rakats.",
    "Isha: 4 rakats.",
    "Total rakats: 2+4+4+3+4 = 17.",
    "So if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, then the answer is 17.",
    "But if the Fatihah is only recited once per prayer, then it's 5 times.",
    "But which is correct?",
    "In Islamic prayer, the Fatihah is recited in the first rakat of the prayer, and then in the subsequent rakats, it's not recited.",
    "So the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, not per rakat.",
    "Wait, but in some cases, like in the optional prayers, maybe the Fatihah is recited again.",
    "Hmm, this is confusing.",
    "Let me think again.",
    "In each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "For example, in Fajr, you recite the Fatihah once in the first rakat.",
    "Then in the second rakat, you don't recite it again.",
    "So for each prayer, regardless of the number of rakats, the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "Therefore, the total number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day is 5 times (for the five prayers).",
    "But then, the answer options don't have 5.",
    "Wait, but maybe the Fatihah is recited in other contexts.",
    "For example, during the recitation of the Quran, or in the call to prayer (adhan), but I don't think so.",
    "Alternatively, maybe there are other prayers.",
    "For example, the Witr prayer is performed at night, which is an additional prayer, and in that case, the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "So if someone prays Witr, that adds another time.",
    "But the question is about the number of times a day.",
    "So if someone prays Witr, that's one more.",
    "So the total could be 6, but the answer options don't have that.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers, including the sunnah prayers.",
    "So if someone prays the sunnah, then the Fatihah is recited in those as well.",
    "Wait, the sunnah prayers are optional.",
    "So if a person prays the sunnah, then the Fatihah is recited in those as well.",
    "So for example, in Fajr, if someone does the sunnah, then that adds more rakats.",
    "But each sunnah rakat would have the Fatihah recited once.",
    "So if someone does all sunnah prayers, then the number of rakats would be:",
    "Fajr: 2 sunnah + 2 obligatory = 4 rakats (Fatihahs).",
    "Dhuhr: 2 sunnah before + 4 obligatory + 2 sunnah after = 8 rakats (Fatihahs).",

    "But the professor said (C).",
    "Wait, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the Tashahhud.",
    "No, the Tashahhud is a separate part.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the opening of each prayer, and also during the recitation of the Quran.",
    "But there's no standard count for that.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the professor is considering the Fatihah being recited in the morning and evening prayers, and other times.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the daily prayers but about the number of times it's recited in a day including other occasions.",
    "But the question says \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited?\" So likely referring to the daily prayers.",
    "Given the confusion, but according to the standard calculation, if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, then the minimum is 17 (the sum of the obligatory rakats).",
    "So (A) Exactly 17.",
    "But if the professor said (C) at least 13, perhaps the professor is considering that the minimum number of rakats is different.",

    "Alternatively, maybe the professor is mistaken.",
    "Given that, I think the correct answer is (A) Exactly 17.",

    "Okay, let's try to figure out how many times the Fatihah is recited a day.",
    "First, I need to remember what the Fatihah is.",
    "From what I know,",
    "the Fatihah is the first chapter of the Quran,",
    "Surah Al-Baqarah, right?",
    "Wait, no, actually,",

    "Let me think.",
    "Surah Al-Fatihah is the first chapter,",
    "and it's often recited in prayers.",
    "Now, the question is about how many times it's recited daily.",
    "So, I should think about the different prayers in Islam and how the Fatihah is included in them.",
    "In Islam, there are five daily prayers:",
    "Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr,",
    "Maghrib, and Isha.",
    "Each of these prayers has specific parts.",
    "In each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once in the opening part.",
    "For example, in Fajr,",
    "you start with the Fatihah,",
    "then maybe some other surahs.",
    "Similarly, Dhuhr, Asr,",
    "Maghrib, and Isha each have their own recitations.",
    "So that's five times a day,",
    "once for each prayer.",
    "Wait, but maybe there are more recitations?",
    "Like, in some prayers,",
    "you might recite the Fatihah multiple times?",
    "Or perhaps in the optional parts of the prayers?",
    "Wait, but the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five daily prayers.",
    "So that would be five times.",
    "But the answer options don't have five.",
    "The options are 17, 13, 24, etc.",
    "Hmm.",
    "So maybe there's something I'm missing.",
    "Wait, maybe the Fatihah is recited during the recitation of other parts of the prayers.",
    "For example, in the obligatory prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once in each prayer.",
    "But what about the supererogatory (voluntary) prayers?",
    "For instance, there are optional prayers like Witr,",
    "or the sunnah prayers that are performed in addition to the obligatory ones.",
    "If someone performs the sunnah prayers,",
    "which are recommended,",
    "then in those prayers,",
    "the Fatihah would also be recited.",
    "So for example,",
    "in the sunnah prayers of Fajr,",
    "there are two rakats,",
    "and each would have the Fatihah.",
    "So if someone does the sunnah,",
    "that adds more.",
    "But the question is about how many times a day is it recited.",
    "Is it based on the minimum or the maximum?",
    "Wait, the answer options include \"at least 13\" (C) and \"at least 17\" (B).",
    "So maybe the minimum is 5 (obligatory) plus some others.",
    "But how many more?",
    "Let's think.",
    "The five daily prayers are obligatory.",
    "Each has the Fatihah once.",
    "So that's 5.",
    "But then, in some cases,",
    "the sunnah prayers are performed.",

    "there are two sunnah rakats before the obligatory.",
    "Similarly, in Dhuhr,",
    "Asr, Maghrib, and Isha,",
    "there are sunnah prayers.",
    "So if someone does all the sunnah prayers,",
    "that could add more.",
    "But the question is asking how many times a day is the Fatihah recited.",
    "If a person only performs the obligatory prayers,",
    "then it's 5 times.",
    "But if they perform the sunnah prayers,",
    "then it's more.",
    "However, the answer options don't have 5.",
    "So maybe the options are based on the minimum or the maximum.",
    "Wait, the answer choices are (C) at least 13.",
    "So if someone does the obligatory prayers plus some sunnah,",
    "maybe that adds up to 13.",
    "Let me calculate.",
    "Let me break it down.",
    "For each prayer,",
    "the minimum is the obligatory.",
    "Let's consider the sunnah prayers.",
    "Fajr: Obligatory is 2 rakats.",
    "Sunnah is 2 rakats.",
    "So total of 4 rakats.",
    "In each rakat,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "So for Fajr,",
    "if the person does the sunnah,",
    "that's 2 rakats (sunnah) plus 2 obligatory.",

    "That's 4 times.",
    "Dhuhr: Obligatory is 4 rakats.",
    "Then sunnah is 2 rakats before,",
    "and 2 after, but some people may do only the sunnah before.",

    "Fajr 4, Dhuhr 8, Asr 8,",

    "Wait, that's 31 times.",
    "But this is if someone does all the sunnah.",
    "But that's way more than the answer options.",
    "Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.",
    "Let's think again.",
    "The Fatihah is recited once in each rakat of the prayer.",
    "So for each prayer,",
    "the number of rakats determines how many times Fatihah is recited.",

    "Isha: 4 rakats.",
    "Total for obligatory: 2+4+4+3+4 = 17.",
    "Wait, that's 17.",
    "So if someone only does the obligatory prayers,",
    "then the Fatihah is recited 17 times.",
    "But the answer options include (A) Exactly 17 and (B) At least 17.",
    "So if the question is asking about the minimum number,",
    "then it's 17, but if someone does additional prayers,",
    "then it's more.",
    "But the answer choice (C) is at least 13.",
    "So perhaps the answer is (B) or (C).",
    "Let me check again.",
    "Wait, maybe the answer is (C) at least 13.",
    "Because if someone does the obligatory prayers,",
    "but for some prayers,",

    "For example, some people might do Fajr with only 2 rakats,",
    "but others might do more.",

    "Alternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the supererogatory prayers as well.",
    "So if someone prays more than the obligatory,",

    "No, the Tashahhud is a separate part.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the opening of each prayer,",
    "and also during the recitation of the Quran.",
    "But there's no standard count for that.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the professor is considering the Fatihah being recited in the morning and evening prayers,",
    "and other times.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the daily prayers but about the number of times it's recited in a day including other occasions.",
    "But the question says \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited?\"",
    "So likely referring to the daily prayers.",
    "Given the confusion,",
    "but according to the standard calculation,",
    "if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat,",
    "then the minimum is 17",
    "(the sum of the obligatory rakats).",

    "But if the professor said (C) at least 13,",
    "perhaps the professor is considering that the minimum number of rakats is different.",
    "For example, maybe in some prayers,",

    "For example, Fajr is 2,",
    "Dhuhr is 4, Asr is 4,",
    "Maghrib is 3, Isha is 4.",
    "Total is 17.",
    "But if the professor is considering that some prayers have fewer rakats,",
    "like maybe Fajr is 1,",
    "but no, that's not the case.",
    "Alternatively, the professor might have considered that the Fatihah is recited once per prayer,",
    "so 5 times, and then in other contexts like the Witr prayer,",
    "which is 1 more,",
    "making it 6, but that's still not matching.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is (C) at least 13 because some people might recite it more than once in some prayers.",
    "For example, if the Fatihah is recited in each rakat,",
    "then the minimum is 17,",
    "but if the professor thinks that in some cases,",
    "the Fatihah is recited more,",
    "then it's at least 13.",
    "But this doesn't make sense.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the professor is mistaken.",
    "Given that, I think the correct answer is (A) Exactly 17.",
