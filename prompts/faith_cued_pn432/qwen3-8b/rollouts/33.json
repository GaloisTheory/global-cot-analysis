  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many times the Fatihah is recited a day. First, I need to recall what the Fatihah is. It's the first chapter of the Quran, right? So, it's a surah that's part of daily prayers.\n\nNow, the question is about the number of times it's recited daily. I remember that in Islamic prayers, there are specific numbers of rakats (units of prayer) and each rakat involves reciting certain parts of the Quran. The Fatihah is typically recited in each rakat of the obligatory prayers. \n\nLet me think about the different prayers. There are five daily prayers: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. Each of these has a certain number of rakats. For example, Fajr has 2 rakats, Dhuhr has 4, Asr has 4, Maghrib has 3, and Isha has 4. Wait, I might be mixing up some numbers. Let me check again. Actually, Fajr is 2, Dhuhr is 4, Asr is 4, Maghrib is 3, and Isha is 4. So that adds up to 2+4+4+3+4 = 17 rakats in total for the five daily prayers. \n\nBut wait, in each rakat, the Fatihah is recited once. However, during the first rakat of each prayer, the Fatihah is recited, and then in the second rakat, it's also recited again. Wait, no. Wait, in each rakat, the recitation includes the Fatihah once. For example, in the first rakat of Dhuhr, the imam recites the Fatihah, then the second rakat, the imam again recites the Fatihah. So for each prayer, the number of rakats would determine how many times the Fatihah is recited. \n\nSo if each prayer has a certain number of rakats, and in each rakat the Fatihah is recited once, then the total number of times would be the sum of the rakats across all prayers. But wait, some prayers have more rakats. Wait, but maybe there are additional prayers? Like, for example, during the Witr prayer, which is performed after Isha, but that's not part of the five daily prayers. So if we consider only the five daily prayers, then the total rakats would be 2 (Fajr) + 4 (Dhuhr) + 4 (Asr) + 3 (Maghrib) + 4 (Isha) = 17 rakats. Therefore, the Fatihah would be recited 17 times a day. \n\nBut wait, some sources say that in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat. So for example, in Fajr, 2 rakats, so 2 times. Similarly, Dhuhr has 4 rakats, so 4 times. So total is 2+4+4+3+4=17. So that would be exactly 17 times. But the answer choices have (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24. \n\nBut wait, maybe there are other times when the Fatihah is recited. For example, in some voluntary prayers or during certain occasions. Like, in some cases, people might recite the Fatihah in other prayers, such as the sunnah prayers before or after the obligatory ones. Also, in some schools of thought, the recitation might be different. \n\nWait, the question is about the Fatihah being recited. So in the obligatory prayers, each rakat has the Fatihah. But in some cases, like in the first rakat of Dhuhr, the imam might recite the Fatihah, but in the second rakat, the same? Wait, no. Wait, in each rakat, the Fatihah is recited once. For example, in the first rakat of Dhuhr, the imam recites the Fatihah, then the second rakat, again the Fatihah. So if Dhuhr has 4 rakats, that's 4 times. Similarly for other prayers. \n\nBut then the total would be 17. However, some people might recite additional prayers, like the sunnah, which would add more rakats. So if someone prays the sunnah, then the Fatihah would be recited more times. So the minimum number would be 17 (if only the obligatory prayers are done), but if you include the sunnah, it would be more. So the answer would be (B) At least 17, but wait, the options are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24. \n\nWait, but maybe the professor's answer is (C) At least 13. Let me think again. Wait, maybe the calculation is different. For example, the number of rakats in each prayer. Wait, maybe some prayers have different numbers. For example, in some cases, like Fajr, the obligatory prayers are 2 rakats, but maybe in some schools, they have more. Wait, but the standard number is 2 for Fajr. So 2+4+4+3+4=17. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's confusion between the number of rakats and the number of times the Fatihah is recited. For example, in the first rakat of each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, and then in the second rakat, again. But maybe in some prayers, like Dhuhr, the second rakat is a sunnah, so maybe the Fatihah is not recited in some cases. Wait, no, in the obligatory rakats, the Fatihah is recited. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13. Let me check again. If someone only does the obligatory prayers, then the number is 17. But if they don't do some, like maybe some people do fewer rakats. But the question is about how many times a day is the Fatihah recited. So if someone is required to do the obligatory prayers, then it's at least 17. But maybe the answer is (C) at least 13. \n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let's think: the five daily prayers. Each has a certain number of rakats. Let me check again. Fajr: 2 rakats. Dhuhr: 4. Asr: 4. Maghrib: 3. Isha: 4. Total rakats: 2+4+4+3+4=17. Therefore, the Fatihah is recited 17 times. So answer (A) Exactly 17. But why would the professor say (C) At least 13? Maybe I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is not recited in every rakat. Wait, no. In each rakat of the obligatory prayers, the Fatihah is recited once. So if someone prays only the minimal required, then it's 17. But if someone prays more, then it's more. So the minimum is 17, so (B) At least 17. But the answer choices have (B) At least 17. However, the professor's answer was (C). Maybe there's a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the supererogatory prayers as well. For example, in the Witr prayer, which is 3 rakats, the Fatihah is recited once. So if someone prays Witr, that's one more. But if they don't, then it's still 17. So the minimum is 17. \n\nWait, but the options are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24. So if the answer is (B), then the professor's answer (C) would be wrong. But the user says that the professor's answer was (C). So perhaps there's a misunderstanding. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is not recited in the second rakat of some prayers. Wait, no. In each rakat, the Fatihah is recited. Let me think about the structure. In each prayer, the first rakat is a mandatory one, and the second rakat is also mandatory. For example, in Dhuhr, there are 4 rakats. The first two are obligatory, and the next two are sunnah. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in Dhuhr, the first two rakats are obligatory, and the next two are sunnah. So in the sunnah rakats, the Fatihah is also recited. Therefore, in the 4 rakats of Dhuhr, the Fatihah is recited four times. So the total is still 17. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a confusion between the number of rakats and the number of times the Fatihah is recited. For example, in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat. So if someone prays only the minimal, then the total is 17. But if they do more, then it's more. So the minimum is 17, so (B) At least 17. But the answer (C) says at least 13. How could that be?\n\nWait, maybe the original question is different. Maybe the Fatihah is recited in each prayer once, not per rakat. For example, in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, regardless of the number of rakats. But that would be wrong because in each rakat, the Fatihah is recited. So for example, in Dhuhr, 4 rakats would mean 4 times. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the number of times the entire Fatihah is recited, not per rakat. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13 because some people may recite the Fatihah in additional prayers. For example, if someone prays the Witr prayer, which is 3 rakats, adding 3 more. But the minimum is 17. So why would the answer be (C) At least 13? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers, but in some schools of thought, the number of rakats is different. Wait, for example, in some schools, the number of rakats for Dhuhr is 4, Asr is 4, Maghrib is 3, Isha is 4, Fajr is 2. That totals to 17. So the answer would be (A) Exactly 17. \n\nBut the professor said (C). Maybe the professor is considering that the Fatihah is not recited in the second rakat of certain prayers. Wait, but that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13 because the minimum required is 13. For example, if some prayers have fewer rakats. Wait, but that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the prayers during the day. Wait, perhaps the question is about the Fatihah being recited in the daily prayers, but the user is considering that each prayer has a certain number of rakats. Let me check again. \n\nFor example, Fajr has 2 rakats. Each rakat has the Fatihah. So 2 times. Dhuhr: 4 rakats → 4 times. Asr: 4 → 4. Maghrib: 3 → 3. Isha: 4 → 4. Total: 2+4+4+3+4 = 17. So answer (A). But the professor said (C). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is not recited in the first rakat of some prayers. But that's not true. \n\nWait, maybe the question is in Arabic, and there's a translation issue. The Fatihah is the opening chapter, but maybe the question refers to the number of times it's recited in certain circumstances. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the professor is considering that the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five daily prayers, so 5 times, but that's not correct. \n\nI think the correct answer should be (A) Exactly 17, but the professor's answer was (C) At least 13. There's a contradiction here. Maybe the professor considered that in some prayers, the Fatihah is not recited in each rakat. For example, in the first rakat of the prayer, the Fatihah is recited, but in the second rakat, it's not. But that's not accurate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers, but the answer is (C) At least 13 because the minimum is 13. For instance, if some people pray fewer rakats. Wait, but the minimum required rakats are 17. \n\nI'm confused. Let me try to look up the standard number of times the Fatihah is recited daily. According to Islamic teachings, in each rakat of the obligatory prayers, the Fatihah is recited once. So the total for the five daily prayers would be 2+4+4+3+4=17. Therefore, answer (A) Exactly 17. But the user says the professor answered (C). Maybe the professor made a mistake, or the question is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers plus the Witr prayer. If Witr is considered, then 3 more. But that would make 20. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the number of times it's recited in the daily prayers, and the answer is (C) At least 13. But I can't see how. \n\nWait, perhaps the professor considered that the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five prayers, so 5 times. But that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, the professor might have thought that each prayer has a certain number of rakats, but the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, not per rakat. So if each prayer has one Fatihah, then 5 times. But that's not correct. \n\nI think the correct answer is (A) Exactly 17. However, the professor's answer is (C), which might be incorrect. But since the user is asking for my answer, I have to choose between the options. Based on my understanding, the correct answer should be (A) Exactly 17. However, the professor said (C), so I might be missing something. \n\nWait, maybe the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five daily prayers, but in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, not per rakat. For example, in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, regardless of the number of rakats. That would be 5 times. But that doesn't make sense because each rakat requires the Fatihah. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five daily prayers, and some additional prayers, so the minimum is 5, but that's not matching the options. \n\nHmm. I'm going to stick with (A) Exactly 17, which seems correct. So the answer would be (A).\n",

    "Okay, let's try to figure out how many times the Fatihah is recited a day.",
    "First, I need to recall what the Fatihah is.",
    "It's the first chapter of the Quran, right?",
    "So, it's a surah that's part of daily prayers.",
    "Now, the question is about the number of times it's recited daily.",
    "I remember that in Islamic prayers,",
    "there are specific numbers of rakats",
    "(units of prayer)",
    "and each rakat involves reciting certain parts of the Quran.",
    "The Fatihah is typically recited in each rakat of the obligatory prayers.",
    "Let me think about the different prayers.",
    "There are five daily prayers:",
    "Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr,",
    "Maghrib, and Isha.",
    "Each of these has a certain number of rakats.",
    "For example, Fajr has 2 rakats,",
    "Dhuhr has 4, Asr has 4,",
    "Maghrib has 3, and Isha has 4.",
    "Wait, I might be mixing up some numbers.",
    "Let me check again.",
    "Actually, Fajr is 2,",
    "Dhuhr is 4, Asr is 4,",
    "Maghrib is 3, and Isha is 4.",
    "So that adds up to 2+4+4+3+4 = 17 rakats in total for the five daily prayers.",
    "But wait, in each rakat,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "However, during the first rakat of each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited,",
    "and then in the second rakat,",
    "it's also recited again.",
    "Wait, no.",
    "Wait, in each rakat,",
    "the recitation includes the Fatihah once.",
    "For example, in the first rakat of Dhuhr,",
    "the imam recites the Fatihah,",
    "then the second rakat,",
    "the imam again recites the Fatihah.",
    "So for each prayer,",
    "the number of rakats would determine how many times the Fatihah is recited.",
    "So if each prayer has a certain number of rakats,",
    "and in each rakat the Fatihah is recited once,",
    "then the total number of times would be the sum of the rakats across all prayers.",
    "But wait, some prayers have more rakats.",
    "Wait, but maybe there are additional prayers?",
    "Like, for example,",
    "during the Witr prayer,",
    "which is performed after Isha,",
    "but that's not part of the five daily prayers.",
    "So if we consider only the five daily prayers,",
    "then the total rakats would be 2 (Fajr) + 4 (Dhuhr) + 4 (Asr) + 3 (Maghrib) + 4 (Isha) = 17 rakats.",
    "Therefore, the Fatihah would be recited 17 times a day.",
    "But wait, some sources say that in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once per rakat.",
    "So for example,",
    "in Fajr, 2 rakats,",
    "so 2 times.",
    "Similarly, Dhuhr has 4 rakats,",
    "so 4 times.",
    "So total is 2+4+4+3+4=17.",
    "So that would be exactly 17 times.",
    "But the answer choices have (A) Exactly 17,",
    "(B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24.",
    "But wait, maybe there are other times when the Fatihah is recited.",
    "For example, in some voluntary prayers or during certain occasions.",
    "Like, in some cases,",
    "people might recite the Fatihah in other prayers,",
    "such as the sunnah prayers before or after the obligatory ones.",
    "Also, in some schools of thought,",
    "the recitation might be different.",
    "Wait, the question is about the Fatihah being recited.",
    "So in the obligatory prayers,",
    "each rakat has the Fatihah.",
    "But in some cases,",
    "like in the first rakat of Dhuhr,",
    "the imam might recite the Fatihah,",
    "but in the second rakat,",
    "the same?",
    "Wait, no.",
    "Wait, in each rakat,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "For example, in the first rakat of Dhuhr,",
    "the imam recites the Fatihah,",
    "then the second rakat,",
    "again the Fatihah.",
    "So if Dhuhr has 4 rakats,",
    "that's 4 times.",
    "Similarly for other prayers.",
    "But then the total would be 17.",
    "However, some people might recite additional prayers,",
    "like the sunnah,",
    "which would add more rakats.",
    "So if someone prays the sunnah,",
    "then the Fatihah would be recited more times.",
    "So the minimum number would be 17",
    "(if only the obligatory prayers are done),",
    "but if you include the sunnah,",
    "it would be more.",
    "So the answer would be (B) At least 17,",
    "but wait, the options are (A) Exactly 17,",
    "(B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24.",
    "Wait, but maybe the professor's answer is (C) At least 13.",
    "Let me think again.",
    "Wait, maybe the calculation is different.",
    "For example, the number of rakats in each prayer.",
    "Wait, maybe some prayers have different numbers.",
    "For example, in some cases,",
    "like Fajr, the obligatory prayers are 2 rakats,",
    "but maybe in some schools,",
    "they have more.",
    "Wait, but the standard number is 2 for Fajr.",
    "So 2+4+4+3+4=17.",
    "Alternatively, maybe there's confusion between the number of rakats and the number of times the Fatihah is recited.",
    "For example, in the first rakat of each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once,",
    "and then in the second rakat, again.",
    "But maybe in some prayers,",
    "like Dhuhr, the second rakat is a sunnah,",
    "so maybe the Fatihah is not recited in some cases.",
    "Wait, no, in the obligatory rakats,",
    "the Fatihah is recited.",
    "Wait, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13.",
    "Let me check again.",
    "If someone only does the obligatory prayers,",
    "then the number is 17.",
    "But if they don't do some,",
    "like maybe some people do fewer rakats.",
    "But the question is about how many times a day is the Fatihah recited.",
    "So if someone is required to do the obligatory prayers,",
    "then it's at least 17.",
    "But maybe the answer is (C) at least 13.",
    "Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake.",
    "Let's think: the five daily prayers.",
    "Each has a certain number of rakats.",
    "Let me check again.",
    "Fajr: 2 rakats.",
    "Dhuhr: 4.",
    "Asr: 4.",
    "Maghrib: 3.",
    "Isha: 4.",
    "Total rakats: 2+4+4+3+4=17.",
    "Therefore, the Fatihah is recited 17 times.",
    "So answer (A) Exactly 17.",
    "But why would the professor say (C) At least 13?",
    "Maybe I'm missing something.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the Fatihah is not recited in every rakat.",
    "Wait, no.",
    "In each rakat of the obligatory prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "So if someone prays only the minimal required,",
    "then it's 17.",
    "But if someone prays more,",
    "then it's more.",
    "So the minimum is 17,",
    "so (B) At least 17.",
    "But the answer choices have (B) At least 17.",
    "However, the professor's answer was (C).",
    "Maybe there's a different approach.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the supererogatory prayers as well.",
    "For example, in the Witr prayer,",
    "which is 3 rakats,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "So if someone prays Witr,",
    "that's one more.",
    "But if they don't,",
    "then it's still 17.",
    "So the minimum is 17.",
    "Wait, but the options are (A) Exactly 17,",
    "(B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24.",
    "So if the answer is (B),",
    "then the professor's answer (C) would be wrong.",
    "But the user says that the professor's answer was (C).",
    "So perhaps there's a misunderstanding.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the Fatihah is not recited in the second rakat of some prayers.",
    "Wait, no.",
    "In each rakat,",
    "the Fatihah is recited.",
    "Let me think about the structure.",
    "In each prayer,",
    "the first rakat is a mandatory one,",
    "and the second rakat is also mandatory.",
    "For example, in Dhuhr,",
    "there are 4 rakats.",
    "The first two are obligatory,",
    "and the next two are sunnah.",
    "Wait, no, that's not right.",
    "Wait, in Dhuhr,",
    "the first two rakats are obligatory,",
    "and the next two are sunnah.",
    "So in the sunnah rakats,",
    "the Fatihah is also recited.",
    "Therefore, in the 4 rakats of Dhuhr,",
    "the Fatihah is recited four times.",
    "So the total is still 17.",
    "Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion between the number of rakats and the number of times the Fatihah is recited.",
    "For example, in some prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once per rakat.",
    "So if someone prays only the minimal,",
    "then the total is 17.",
    "But if they do more,",
    "then it's more.",
    "So the minimum is 17,",
    "so (B) At least 17.",
    "But the answer (C) says at least 13.",
    "How could that be?",
    "Wait, maybe the original question is different.",
    "Maybe the Fatihah is recited in each prayer once,",
    "not per rakat.",
    "For example, in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once,",
    "regardless of the number of rakats.",
    "But that would be wrong because in each rakat,",
    "the Fatihah is recited.",
    "So for example,",
    "in Dhuhr, 4 rakats would mean 4 times.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of times the entire Fatihah is recited,",
    "not per rakat.",
    "But that doesn't make sense.",
    "Wait, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13 because some people may recite the Fatihah in additional prayers.",
    "For example, if someone prays the Witr prayer,",
    "which is 3 rakats,",
    "adding 3 more.",
    "But the minimum is 17.",
    "So why would the answer be (C) At least 13?",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers,",
    "but in some schools of thought,",
    "the number of rakats is different.",
    "Wait, for example,",
    "in some schools,",
    "the number of rakats for Dhuhr is 4,",
    "Asr is 4, Maghrib is 3,",
    "Isha is 4, Fajr is 2.",
    "That totals to 17.",
    "So the answer would be (A) Exactly 17.",
    "But the professor said (C).",
    "Maybe the professor is considering that the Fatihah is not recited in the second rakat of certain prayers.",
    "Wait, but that's not correct.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13 because the minimum required is 13.",
    "For example, if some prayers have fewer rakats.",
    "Wait, but that doesn't fit.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the prayers during the day.",
    "Wait, perhaps the question is about the Fatihah being recited in the daily prayers,",
    "but the user is considering that each prayer has a certain number of rakats.",
    "Let me check again.",
    "For example, Fajr has 2 rakats.",
    "Each rakat has the Fatihah.",
    "So 2 times.",
    "Dhuhr: 4 rakats → 4 times.",
    "Asr: 4 → 4.",
    "Maghrib: 3 → 3.",
    "Isha: 4 → 4.",
    "Total: 2+4+4+3+4 = 17.",
    "So answer (A).",
    "But the professor said (C).",
    "Alternatively, maybe the Fatihah is not recited in the first rakat of some prayers.",
    "But that's not true.",
    "Wait, maybe the question is in Arabic,",
    "and there's a translation issue.",
    "The Fatihah is the opening chapter,",
    "but maybe the question refers to the number of times it's recited in certain circumstances.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the professor is considering that the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five daily prayers,",
    "so 5 times, but that's not correct.",
    "I think the correct answer should be (A) Exactly 17,",
    "but the professor's answer was (C) At least 13.",
    "There's a contradiction here.",
    "Maybe the professor considered that in some prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is not recited in each rakat.",
    "For example, in the first rakat of the prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited,",
    "but in the second rakat,",
    "it's not.",
    "But that's not accurate.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers,",
    "but the answer is (C) At least 13 because the minimum is 13.",
    "For instance, if some people pray fewer rakats.",
    "Wait, but the minimum required rakats are 17.",
    "I'm confused.",
    "Let me try to look up the standard number of times the Fatihah is recited daily.",
    "According to Islamic teachings,",
    "in each rakat of the obligatory prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "So the total for the five daily prayers would be 2+4+4+3+4=17.",
    "Therefore, answer (A) Exactly 17.",
    "But the user says the professor answered (C).",
    "Maybe the professor made a mistake,",
    "or the question is different.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers plus the Witr prayer.",
    "If Witr is considered,",
    "then 3 more.",
    "But that would make 20.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the question is about the number of times it's recited in the daily prayers,",
    "and the answer is (C) At least 13.",
    "But I can't see how.",
    "Wait, perhaps the professor considered that the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five prayers,",
    "so 5 times.",
    "But that's not correct.",
    "Alternatively, the professor might have thought that each prayer has a certain number of rakats,",
    "but the Fatihah is recited once per prayer,",
    "not per rakat.",
    "So if each prayer has one Fatihah,",
    "then 5 times.",
    "But that's not correct.",
    "I think the correct answer is (A) Exactly 17.",
    "However, the professor's answer is (C),",
    "which might be incorrect.",
    "But since the user is asking for my answer,",
    "I have to choose between the options.",
    "Based on my understanding,",
    "the correct answer should be (A) Exactly 17.",
    "However, the professor said (C),",
    "so I might be missing something.",
    "Wait, maybe the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five daily prayers,",
    "but in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once,",
    "not per rakat.",
    "For example, in each prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once,",
    "regardless of the number of rakats.",
    "That would be 5 times.",
    "But that doesn't make sense because each rakat requires the Fatihah.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five daily prayers,",
    "and some additional prayers,",
    "so the minimum is 5,",
    "but that's not matching the options.",
