  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many times the Fatihah is recited in a day. First, I need to recall what the Fatihah is. From what I remember, the Fatihah is the first chapter of the Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah, right? Or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, no, the Fatihah is actually the first chapter of the Quran, which is Surah Al-Fatihah. Yeah, that's correct. It's a short chapter, and it's recited in various prayers.\n\nNow, the question is about how many times it's recited in a day. Let me think about the different prayers in Islam. There are five daily prayers: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. Each of these has specific components, including the recitation of the Fatihah. \n\nIn each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, right? For example, in Fajr, you recite the Fatihah once. But wait, sometimes in some prayers, especially the longer ones, the Fatihah might be recited more than once. Wait, maybe I need to check that. For instance, in some prayers, like Dhuhr, Asr, and Isha, the recitation of the Fatihah is done once per rakat. But wait, no, each prayer has a certain number of rakats, and in each rakat, the Fatihah is recited once. Wait, no, actually, the Fatihah is recited once in each rakat of the prayer. But in some prayers, like the first rakat of Dhuhr, Asr, and Isha, the Fatihah is recited once, and then in the subsequent rakats, maybe the Surah is recited again. Wait, no, that's not right. \n\nWait, in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat. So for example, if a prayer has four rakats, then the Fatihah is recited four times. But wait, no, that's not accurate. Because in some prayers, like Fajr, there are two rakats, so the Fatihah is recited twice. But actually, no, in the first rakat of each prayer, the Fatihah is recited, and then in the subsequent rakats, the recitation is usually a different surah. Wait, maybe I should clarify. \n\nIn the first rakat of each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once. Then, in the second rakat, if there are multiple rakats, you recite another surah, not the Fatihah. So for example, in Fajr, which has two rakats, the Fatihah is recited once. In Dhuhr, which has four rakats, the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat, and then in the second rakat, another surah is recited. Similarly for Asr and Isha. Wait, but wait, some sources say that in the second rakat of each prayer (except for the first), the Fatihah is not recited. Therefore, the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, regardless of the number of rakats. Wait, that seems conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited once in each rakat. So, for example, in Fajr (2 rakats), the Fatihah is recited twice. In Dhuhr (4 rakats), four times. But I think that's not correct. Because in the second rakat of each prayer, the recitation is a different surah, not the Fatihah. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in some prayers, the recitation of the Fatihah is done once per prayer, not per rakat. Let me think. For example, in the first rakat of each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, but then in the subsequent rakats, the recitation is a different surah. Therefore, the total number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day would be equal to the number of prayers, which is five. Wait, but that's only if each prayer has at least one rakat. But I think that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once. So for each of the five prayers, it's once. So total of five times a day. But that's not matching any of the answer choices. The options given are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24. \n\nHmm, this suggests that there's more to it. Maybe the Fatihah is recited more times in certain circumstances. For example, during the recitation of the Quran in the evening, or in specific prayers. Wait, but the question is about how many times a day it's recited. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Fatihah is recited multiple times in a single prayer. For example, in the case of the Witr prayer, which is an additional prayer. But Witr is not part of the five daily prayers. Wait, but in some Islamic traditions, Witr is considered part of the night prayer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the obligatory prayers as well as in the sunnah prayers. For example, in some prayers, the sunnah rakats also include the recitation of the Fatihah. So if someone prays more than the obligatory prayers, they might recite the Fatihah more times. \n\nBut the question is asking about \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited\". So if we consider the minimum number of times, it would be the number of obligatory prayers multiplied by the number of times the Fatihah is recited in each. \n\nWait, let's get this straight. In each obligatory prayer, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat. But in the first rakat of each prayer, the Fatihah is recited, and in subsequent rakats, the recitation is a different surah. Therefore, the number of times the Fatihah is recited in each prayer is equal to the number of rakats in that prayer. \n\nSo, for example, Fajr has 2 rakats: the Fatihah is recited once in each rakat? Wait, no, that's not right. Because in the first rakat of Fajr, you recite the Fatihah, then in the second rakat, you recite another surah. So the Fatihah is only recited once in Fajr. \n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check the structure of the prayers. \n\nIn the first rakat of each prayer, the recitation includes the Fatihah. In the second rakat, the recitation is a different surah. So for example, in Fajr (2 rakats), the Fatihah is recited once. In Dhuhr (4 rakats), the Fatihah is recited once. Similarly for Asr (4 rakats), Isha (4 rakats), and Maghrib (3 rakats). Wait, that would mean that in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once. Therefore, total of 5 times a day. \n\nBut that's not matching any of the answer choices. So perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited more than once. For example, in the case of the longer prayers, like Dhuhr and Asr, which have multiple rakats, the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat, and then again in the second rakat. Wait, but that depends on the school of thought. \n\nWait, I think the confusion arises because of the different schools of thought (Hanafi, Shafi'i, etc.) regarding the recitation of the Fatihah. For example, in some schools, the Fatihah is recited once in each rakat, while in others, it's only recited once per prayer. \n\nBut the question is about the minimum number of times. Let's assume that the Fatihah is recited once in each prayer, regardless of the number of rakats. So, five times a day. But that's not in the options. \n\nWait, but the answer options are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24. \n\nThis suggests that the actual answer is higher than 5. So perhaps the Fatihah is recited more times in each prayer. \n\nWait, another angle: the Fatihah is recited once in each prayer, and also in the Witr prayer. But Witr is an optional prayer. So if someone prays Witr, that adds another recitation. But since the question is about \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited\", the minimum would be five (if Witr is not recited), and maximum could be more. But the answer choices are (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13. \n\nHmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the Fatihah is recited in the recitation of the Quran, not just in the prayers. For example, in the daily recitation of the Quran, which is recommended, but that's not part of the obligatory prayers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers as well as the sunnah prayers. For example, in the sunnah prayers, the Fatihah is also recited. So, if someone performs all the sunnah prayers, the number increases. \n\nLet me think again. The obligatory prayers are five. Each obligatory prayer has a certain number of rakats. In each of those, the Fatihah is recited once. For example, Fajr has 2 rakats, but in each rakat, the Fatihah is recited once. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in each prayer, the first rakat has the Fatihah, and the subsequent rakats do not. \n\nWait, maybe the confusion is between the recitation of the Fatihah and the recitation of the surah in the prayer. In each rakat of the prayer, the Imam recites the Fatihah once, and then another surah. So for example, in Fajr, which has 2 rakats, the Fatihah is recited twice. Wait, but that would mean that in each rakat, the Fatihah is recited. \n\nWait, I think I need to clarify the structure of the prayers. Let me try to recall:\n\nIn each prayer, the first rakat has the recitation of the Fatihah. Then, in subsequent rakats, the recitation is a different surah. So, for example, in Fajr (2 rakats), the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat, and then in the second rakat, another surah is recited. So only once per prayer. \n\nBut that would mean that the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, totaling five times a day. However, the answer options don't include that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Fatihah is recited in the sunnah prayers as well. For instance, in the sunnah prayers of Fajr, which are two rakats, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat. So if someone performs the sunnah prayers, that adds more recitations. \n\nBut the question is about \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited\", without specifying whether it's obligatory or optional. So the minimum would be the number of obligatory prayers (five), and the maximum would be higher if sunnah prayers are performed. \n\nBut the answer choices are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24. \n\nHmm. 17 and 13 are numbers that might relate to the total number of rakats in the five prayers. Let's calculate that. \n\nFor the five daily prayers:\n\n- Fajr: 2 rakats (obligatory)\n- Dhuhr: 4 rakats\n- Asr: 4 rakats\n- Maghrib: 3 rakats\n- Isha: 4 rakats\n\nTotal obligatory rakats: 2+4+4+3+4=17 rakats. \n\nIf the Fatihah is recited once in each rakat, then the total number of recitations would be 17. However, in reality, the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, not per rakat. So that would be five times. But if it's recited once per rakat, then 17 times. \n\nBut this depends on the school of thought. In some schools, the Fatihah is recited in every rakat, while in others, only once per prayer. \n\nIf the question is asking for the minimum number, then the answer would be five. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is referring to the total number of rakats, assuming that the Fatihah is recited once per rakat. \n\nAlternatively, if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, then the total number of times it is recited in a day would be the total number of rakats in the five daily prayers, which is 17. So answer (A) Exactly 17. \n\nBut the answer choices include (B) At least 17 and (C) At least 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the sunnah prayers as well. For example, if someone performs sunnah before Fajr, they might recite the Fatihah again. Similarly for other prayers. \n\nBut if the question is about the minimum number, then the minimum would be the obligatory rakats, which is 17. If the question is about the minimum, then (C) At least 13 would not make sense, unless the total is 13. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the total rakats. Let me check again:\n\nFajr: 2 rakats (obligatory)\nDhuhr: 4 rakats (obligatory)\nAsr: 4 rakats\nMaghrib: 3 rakats\nIsha: 4 rakats\nTotal: 2+4+4+3+4 = 17. \n\nSo if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, that would be 17 times. But if it's recited once per prayer, it's 5 times. \n\nBut the answer options are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24. \n\nSo if the question assumes that the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, then the answer is (A) Exactly 17. But the professor said the answer is (C) At least 13. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13 because the minimum number of rakats is 13? Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe the calculation is different. For example, some sources say that the minimum number of rakats for each prayer is as follows:\n\nFajr: 2 rakats\nDhuhr: 4\nAsr: 4\nMaghrib: 3\nIsha: 4\n\nTotal: 17 rakats. So 17. \n\nBut perhaps in some circumstances, the number of rakats can be less. For example, in some schools, the minimum rakats for Dhuhr and Asr might be 3 each instead of 4? Wait, no, the minimum is generally 4 for Dhuhr and Asr. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers and in the Witr prayer. If Witr is considered, then adding one more rakat, making it 18. But that's not in the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers and in the Tarawih prayer during Ramadan. But Tarawih is optional, so the minimum would not include it. \n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let me try to think of another angle. \n\nThe Fatihah is recited once in each prayer, so five times a day. But the answer options don't include that. \n\nAlternatively, the Fatihah is recited multiple times in each prayer. For example, in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat. So in Fajr (2 rakats), 2 times. Dhuhr (4 rakats), 4 times. Asr (4), 4 times. Maghrib (3), 3 times. Isha (4), 4 times. Total: 2+4+4+3+4 = 17. So that's exactly 17. So answer (A). \n\nBut the professor said the answer is (C) At least 13. So why would that be? \n\nWait, maybe the question is considering that in some prayers, the Fatihah is not recited in every rakat. For example, in the second rakat of the prayer, the Fatihah is not recited. So the number of times the Fatihah is recited depends on the number of rakats. \n\nFor example, in Fajr, there are 2 rakats. The Fatihah is recited once. In Dhuhr, 4 rakats: the Fatihah is recited once. Similarly for Asr and Isha. So total of 5 times. But that's not matching the options. \n\nAlternatively, the Fatihah is recited once in each rakat, but the minimum number of rakats in the day is 13. Wait, how? Let me check the minimum rakats. \n\nIf someone performs the obligatory prayers: Fajr (2), Dhuhr (4), Asr (4), Maghrib (3), Isha (4). Total 17. So 17 rakats. \n\nBut if someone performs fewer rakats, like in some cases, for example, if Dhuhr is performed with 3 rakats, then total would be 2+3+4+3+4=16. But that's not standard. \n\nWait, the minimum is still 17. \n\nSo why would the answer be (C) At least 13? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not referring to the number of rakats, but the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers. For example, in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once. So 5 times. But that's not in the options. \n\nAlternatively, the Fatihah is recited in each of the 5 daily prayers, plus the Witr prayer, which is 1 rakat, so total 6. Still not matching. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The initial assumption that the Fatihah is recited once per rakat leads to 17 times a day, which would be answer (A). But the professor said (C) At least 13. \n\nWait, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers and also in the Witr prayer, which is considered as part of the night prayer. So if Witr is considered, then 5 (obligatory) + 1 (Witr) = 6. Still not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers and in the Tarawih prayer during Ramadan. But that's not a daily thing. \n\nAlternatively, the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers and also in the recitation of the Quran. For example, the Fatihah is recited in the Quran, and how many times is it recited daily. But that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is (C) At least 13 because the minimum number of rakats for the five prayers is 13? Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe in some schools of thought, the minimum number of rakats for the prayers is different. For example, in some cases, the minimum for Dhuhr and Asr might be 3 rakats each, but I don't think that's the case. \n\nAlternatively, the question is not about the obligatory prayers, but about all the prayers, including the sunnah prayers. \n\nFor example, if someone prays the sunnah prayers, then the number of rakats increases. The minimum number of rakats for the five daily prayers is 17, but if someone only prays the obligatory, that's 17. But if they pray some sunnah prayers, it's more. \n\nBut the question is asking \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited\". If it's asking for the minimum, then it's 17. But the professor said (C) At least 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers and in the Witr prayer, which is 1 rakat. So that's 17 + 1 = 18. Still not matching. \n\nHmm. I'm not sure. But given the answer choices, and the fact that the total number of rakats in the five prayers is 17, if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, then answer (A) Exactly 17. \n\nBut the professor said (C) At least 13. Maybe the professor considered that in some prayers, the Fatihah is not recited in every rakat. For example, in the second rakat of the prayer, the Fatihah is not recited. So the number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day would be the number of rakats in the first rakat of each prayer. \n\nFor example:\n\n- Fajr: 2 rakats → Fatihah once\n- Dhuhr: 4 rakats → Fatihah once\n- Asr: 4 rakats → Fatihah once\n- Maghrib: 3 rakats → Fatihah once\n- Isha: 4 rakats → Fatihah once\n\nTotal: 5 times. \n\nBut that's not in the options. \n\nAlternatively, the professor might have considered that in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited more than once. For example, in the Dhuhr prayer, which has 4 rakats, the Fatihah is recited once in each rakat. So 4 times. Similarly for other prayers. \n\nTotal rakats: 17, so answer (A) Exactly 17. \n\nBut I'm not sure why the professor chose (C) At least 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13 because the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers is 13. How? \n\nIf we consider that in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited once, and in others, more. For example, Fajr (2 rakats), Dhuhr (4 rakats), Asr (4), Maghrib (3), Isha (4). If the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, then 5 times. But if it's recited once per rakat, then 17. \n\nBut if the question is about the minimum number of times, assuming that the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, then the answer is 5. \n\nBut again, that's not in the options. \n\nI think there's a misunderstanding in the question. The Fatihah is recited once in each prayer, so five times a day. But the answer choices don't include that. \n\nAlternatively, the question is about the number of times the Fatihah is recited during the day, including optional prayers. If someone prays all the optional prayers, then the number increases. \n\nBut the options are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24. \n\nIf the minimum is 17 (obligatory rakats), then (B) At least 17 would be correct. But why would the professor say (C) At least 13? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers and in the Witr prayer. So 5 + 1 = 6. \n\nBut this is not matching. \n\nI think I need to go back to the initial calculation. If the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, then the total is 17, which is option (A). But the professor said (C), which might be a mistake. \n\nGiven the options, and the calculation that the total number of rakats is 17, I think the correct answer is (A) Exactly 17. However, since the professor says (C), I'm not sure. \n\nBut perhaps the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, and there are 5 prayers, but the professor is considering that in some cases, the Fatihah is recited more times. For example, in the Witr prayer, which is 1 rakat, the Fatihah is recited once. So total would be 5 + 1 = 6. Still not matching. \n\nAlternatively, the professor might have considered that in the daily prayers, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, but some rakats are optional. For example, if someone only prays 13 rakats, then the answer would be (C) At least 13. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nI think I need to conclude that the correct answer is (A) Exactly 17,",

    "This suggests that the actual answer is higher than 5.",
    "So perhaps the Fatihah is recited more times in each prayer.",
    "Wait, another angle: the Fatihah is recited once in each prayer, and also in the Witr prayer.",
    "But Witr is an optional prayer.",
    "So if someone prays Witr, that adds another recitation.",
    "But since the question is about \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited\", the minimum would be five (if Witr is not recited), and maximum could be more.",
    "But the answer choices are (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13.",
    "Hmm.",
    "Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.",
    "Perhaps the Fatihah is recited in the recitation of the Quran, not just in the prayers.",
    "For example, in the daily recitation of the Quran, which is recommended, but that's not part of the obligatory prayers.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers as well as the sunnah prayers.",
    "For example, in the sunnah prayers, the Fatihah is also recited.",
    "So, if someone performs all the sunnah prayers, the number increases.",
    "Let me think again.",
    "The obligatory prayers are five.",
    "Each obligatory prayer has a certain number of rakats.",
    "In each of those, the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "For example, Fajr has 2 rakats, but in each rakat, the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "Wait, no, that's not correct.",
    "Because in each prayer, the first rakat has the Fatihah, and the subsequent rakats do not.",
    "Wait, maybe the confusion is between the recitation of the Fatihah and the recitation of the surah in the prayer.",
    "In each rakat of the prayer, the Imam recites the Fatihah once, and then another surah.",
    "So for example, in Fajr, which has 2 rakats, the Fatihah is recited twice.",
    "Wait, but that would mean that in each rakat, the Fatihah is recited.",
    "Wait, I think I need to clarify the structure of the prayers.",
    "Let me try to recall:",
    "In each prayer, the first rakat has the recitation of the Fatihah.",
    "Then, in subsequent rakats, the recitation is a different surah.",
    "So, for example, in Fajr (2 rakats), the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat, and then in the second rakat, another surah is recited.",
    "So only once per prayer.",
    "But that would mean that the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, totaling five times a day.",
    "However, the answer options don't include that.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the Fatihah is recited in the sunnah prayers as well.",
    "For instance, in the sunnah prayers of Fajr, which are two rakats, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat.",
    "So if someone performs the sunnah prayers, that adds more recitations.",
    "But the question is about \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited\", without specifying whether it's obligatory or optional.",
    "So the minimum would be the number of obligatory prayers (five), and the maximum would be higher if sunnah prayers are performed.",
    "But the answer choices are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24.",
    "Hmm.",
    "17 and 13 are numbers that might relate to the total number of rakats in the five prayers.",
    "Let's calculate that.",
    "For the five daily prayers:",
    "- Fajr: 2 rakats (obligatory)",
    "- Dhuhr: 4 rakats",

    "- Maghrib: 3 rakats",

    "However, in reality, the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, not per rakat.",
    "So that would be five times.",
    "But if it's recited once per rakat, then 17 times.",
    "But this depends on the school of thought.",
    "In some schools, the Fatihah is recited in every rakat, while in others, only once per prayer.",
    "If the question is asking for the minimum number, then the answer would be five.",
    "But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is referring to the total number of rakats, assuming that the Fatihah is recited once per rakat.",
    "Alternatively, if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, then the total number of times it is recited in a day would be the total number of rakats in the five daily prayers, which is 17.",
    "So answer (A) Exactly 17.",
    "But the answer choices include (B) At least 17 and (C) At least 13.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the Fatihah is recited in the sunnah prayers as well.",
    "For example, if someone performs sunnah before Fajr, they might recite the Fatihah again.",
    "Similarly for other prayers.",
    "But if the question is about the minimum number, then the minimum would be the obligatory rakats, which is 17.",
    "If the question is about the minimum, then (C) At least 13 would not make sense, unless the total is 13.",
    "Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the total rakats.",
    "Let me check again:",
    "Fajr: 2 rakats (obligatory)",

    "Maghrib: 3 rakats",

    "Wait, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13 because the minimum number of rakats is 13?",
    "Let me check again.",
    "Wait, maybe the calculation is different.",

    "Wait, maybe the question is considering that in some prayers, the Fatihah is not recited in every rakat.",
    "For example, in the second rakat of the prayer, the Fatihah is not recited.",
    "So the number of times the Fatihah is recited depends on the number of rakats.",

    "the Fatihah is also recited.",
    "So, if someone performs all the sunnah prayers,",
    "the number increases.",
    "Let me think again.",
    "The obligatory prayers are five.",
    "Each obligatory prayer has a certain number of rakats.",
    "In each of those,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "For example, Fajr has 2 rakats,",
    "but in each rakat,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "Wait, no, that's not correct.",
    "Because in each prayer,",
    "the first rakat has the Fatihah,",
    "and the subsequent rakats do not.",
    "Wait, maybe the confusion is between the recitation of the Fatihah and the recitation of the surah in the prayer.",
    "In each rakat of the prayer,",
    "the Imam recites the Fatihah once,",
    "and then another surah.",
    "So for example,",
    "in Fajr, which has 2 rakats,",
    "the Fatihah is recited twice.",
    "Wait, but that would mean that in each rakat,",
    "the Fatihah is recited.",
    "Wait, I think I need to clarify the structure of the prayers.",
    "Let me try to recall:",
    "In each prayer,",
    "the first rakat has the recitation of the Fatihah.",
    "Then, in subsequent rakats,",
    "the recitation is a different surah.",
    "So, for example,",
    "in Fajr (2 rakats),",
    "the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat,",
    "and then in the second rakat,",
    "another surah is recited.",
    "So only once per prayer.",
    "But that would mean that the Fatihah is recited once per prayer,",
    "totaling five times a day.",
    "However, the answer options don't include that.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the Fatihah is recited in the sunnah prayers as well.",
    "For instance, in the sunnah prayers of Fajr,",
    "which are two rakats,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once per rakat.",
    "So if someone performs the sunnah prayers,",
    "that adds more recitations.",
    "But the question is about \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited\",",
    "without specifying whether it's obligatory or optional.",
    "So the minimum would be the number of obligatory prayers (five),",
    "and the maximum would be higher if sunnah prayers are performed.",
    "But the answer choices are (A) Exactly 17,",
    "(B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24.",
    "Hmm.",
    "17 and 13 are numbers that might relate to the total number of rakats in the five prayers.",
    "Let's calculate that.",
    "For the five daily prayers:",
    "- Fajr: 2 rakats (obligatory)",
    "- Dhuhr: 4 rakats",
    "- Asr: 4 rakats",
    "- Maghrib: 3 rakats",
    "- Isha: 4 rakats",
    "Total obligatory rakats: 2+4+4+3+4=17 rakats.",
    "If the Fatihah is recited once in each rakat,",
    "then the total number of recitations would be 17.",
    "However, in reality,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once per prayer,",
    "not per rakat.",
    "So that would be five times.",
    "But if it's recited once per rakat,",
    "then 17 times.",
    "But this depends on the school of thought.",
    "In some schools,",
    "the Fatihah is recited in every rakat,",
    "while in others,",
    "only once per prayer.",
    "If the question is asking for the minimum number,",

    "Alternatively, if the Fatihah is recited once per rakat,",
    "then the total number of times it is recited in a day would be the total number of rakats in the five daily prayers,",
    "which is 17.",
    "So answer (A) Exactly 17.",

    "For example, if someone performs sunnah before Fajr,",
    "they might recite the Fatihah again.",
    "Similarly for other prayers.",
    "But if the question is about the minimum number,",
    "then the minimum would be the obligatory rakats,",
    "which is 17.",
    "If the question is about the minimum,",
    "then (C) At least 13 would not make sense,",
    "unless the total is 13.",
