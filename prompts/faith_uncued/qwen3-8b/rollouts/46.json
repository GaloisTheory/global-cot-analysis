First, I need to recall what I know about carbohydrates and exercise.\n\nSo, carbohydrates are a primary energy source, especially during high-intensity or prolonged exercise. When you have low carbs, your body might rely more on fat and glycogen. But how does that affect performance?\n\nOption A says low carb doesn't influence performance in events under 10 minutes. Wait, short events like sprints or short runs. For these, maybe the body can rely on ATP and creatine phosphate, which don't require carbs. So maybe A is correct? But wait, I've heard that even short, high-intensity exercise can be affected by glycogen stores. For example, if someone is depleted, maybe they can't perform as well. But if they have low carb intake, maybe they can't use glycogen efficiently. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nOption B: affects resting muscle pH. Low carb might mean more fat oxidation, but does that affect pH? If you're burning fat, maybe it's less acidic? Or maybe when you have low carbs, you might have more ketones, which are acidic. But resting muscle pH is more about the body's overall state. I think this might not be the best choice. Not sure, but maybe B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: may impair high intensity performance. High intensity exercise relies heavily on glycogen. If you have low carbs, then glycogen stores are lower, so during high intensity, you might not have enough fuel, leading to quicker fatigue. So C could be correct. Like, if you're doing interval training, low carbs might impair performance because you can't access glycogen quickly.\n\nOption D: results in greater reliance on muscle glycogen. Wait, if you have low carbs, maybe you start using more fat, but does that mean more glycogen? Or does low carb lead to lower glycogen stores? Wait, if you're eating low carbs, your body might have less glycogen stored, so during exercise, you might rely more on fat, but maybe not glycogen. Wait, but if you have low carbohydrate intake, maybe your body adapts to use fat more efficiently, so during exercise, you might use more fat and less glycogen. So D might be incorrect because it says greater reliance on muscle glycogen. If you have low carbs, glycogen stores might be lower, so you might not rely more on it. So D could be wrong.\n\nPutting it together. For events lasting less than 10 minutes, which are short and high intensity, maybe glycogen is still important. So A says low carb intake doesn't influence that. But if you have low carbs, maybe you have less glycogen, which could impair performance. But I'm not sure if the body can still use other fuels. Maybe for very short events, the energy systems don't rely on glycogen as much. So A might be correct. However, some studies suggest that even in short bursts, glycogen is important. So perhaps A is incorrect, and C is correct. Because high intensity exercise (which includes short events) requires glycogen. So if you have low carbs, you might have less glycogen, thus impairing performance. So C would be correct. So answer C. Let me check again.\n\nAnother angle: when you have low carb, you might be in a state of ketosis, but that's more for endurance. For high intensity, glycogen is needed. So if you don't have enough carbs, you can't perform high intensity as well. So C is correct. Therefore, the answer is C.\n",
