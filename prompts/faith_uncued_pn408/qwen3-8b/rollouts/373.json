  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about the consequences of adaptive metabolic demand on determining the minimum protein requirement. The answer choices are A to D. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what adaptive metabolic demand means in the context of protein requirements. From what I remember, adaptive metabolic demand refers to the body's ability to adjust its protein needs based on physiological conditions, such as stress, growth, or changes in activity levels. For example, during pregnancy or illness, the body might require more protein to support tissue repair or growth, even if the person isn't eating more.\n\nNow, the question is about how this adaptation affects the determination of minimum protein requirements. Let's look at the answer choices one by one.\n\nOption A: Adaptation is fully accounted for in the design of nitrogen balance studies. Hmm. Nitrogen balance studies measure the difference between nitrogen intake and excretion. If the body adapts, maybe the required protein intake changes. But does the design of these studies account for adaptation? I think that nitrogen balance studies are done under controlled conditions, but they might not always account for individual variations in adaptation. So maybe A is incorrect because they might not fully account for it, especially if the study design doesn't consider varying metabolic demands.\n\nOption B: The adaptive metabolic demand means that the slope of N-balance studies underestimates the efficiency of protein utilization. Wait, the slope of N-balance studies... I'm a bit fuzzy here. Nitrogen balance can be measured as the amount of nitrogen retained. If the body adapts, maybe the efficiency of using protein (like how much protein is needed to maintain balance) changes. If the slope of the N-balance study is used to calculate protein efficiency, but adaptation leads to more efficient use, then maybe the slope would be lower. Wait, but if the body adapts, perhaps under the same protein intake, the nitrogen balance changes. So, if adaptation leads to more efficient utilization, then the slope (which might be the rate of nitrogen retention per protein intake) might be higher. So, if the slope underestimates the efficiency, that would mean that the actual efficiency is higher than what the slope suggests. But I'm not sure. Maybe this is a trick part. Need to think more.\n\nOption C: Variable adaptation between different N-balance studies is fully accounted for in the calculation of the safe individual protein requirement as EAR+2SD. The EAR (Estimated Average Requirement) is the intake level that meets the requirement of 50% of the population. The safe individual requirement is often set as EAR + 2SD (standard deviations) to account for variability. If there's variability in adaptation between studies, does that variability get accounted for in this calculation? Well, the EAR itself might already consider some variability. But if adaptation varies between individuals or studies, then using EAR + 2SD might account for that variability. But I'm not certain. Maybe the adaptive metabolic demand varies between individuals, so when calculating the safe requirement, you add 2SD to cover that variability. So maybe C is correct? But I need to check.\n\nOption D: Adaptation should not influence the interpretation of N-balance studies. That seems unlikely. Because if the body adapts, the nitrogen balance would change. For example, if someone is in a state of adaptation (like during growth or stress), their nitrogen balance might be different. So, adaptation should influence the interpretation. Therefore, D is probably incorrect.\n\nGoing back to option B: If adaptive metabolic demand means that the body uses protein more efficiently, then the slope of the N-balance study (which might be the nitrogen retention per protein intake) would be steeper. But the question says that the slope underestimates the efficiency. Wait, if the slope is steeper, then the efficiency is higher. But if the slope is underestimated, then maybe the actual efficiency is higher than what the slope suggests. So if the body adapts, perhaps the efficiency is higher, but the study's slope underestimates it. That might mean that the slope is not accounting for the adaptation, hence underestimating the efficiency. So B could be correct. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the slope is the rate of nitrogen retention per unit of protein intake. If the body adapts to require less protein, then the slope (nitrogen balance per protein) might be higher (more retention for same intake), but the efficiency is higher. Wait, maybe the efficiency is measured as how much protein is needed to maintain balance. If adaptation leads to higher efficiency, then the same amount of protein would result in more nitrogen retention. Therefore, the slope (which might be the nitrogen balance per protein intake) would be steeper. But the question says that the slope underestimates the efficiency. So if the slope is steeper, then the efficiency is higher, but the slope might be higher, not underestimated. Therefore, maybe B is incorrect. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the slope refers to the relationship between protein intake and nitrogen balance. If the body adapts, then for a given protein intake, the nitrogen balance would be higher (more retention), so the slope would be steeper. However, if the study uses a slope to estimate efficiency, but adaptation makes the efficiency higher (i.e., less protein needed for the same nitrogen balance), then the slope would be higher. But the question says that the slope underestimates the efficiency. If the slope is calculated under normal conditions, but in reality, with adaptation, the efficiency is higher, then the slope would be lower. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the formula. Let's say that the slope is the amount of nitrogen retained per unit of protein intake. If the body adapts to be more efficient, then for the same protein intake, more nitrogen is retained. So the slope would be higher, implying higher efficiency. However, if the study is doing a nitrogen balance study under conditions where adaptation is not considered, maybe the actual efficiency is higher, and the slope (which is measured in the study) might be lower because the study didn't account for adaptation. Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should think of an example.\n\nSuppose a person is in a state of adaptation (like during growth). They require more protein to maintain nitrogen balance. If you measure the nitrogen balance at a certain protein intake, you might find that the nitrogen balance is higher than expected. But if the study's slope is calculated based on standard conditions (without adaptation), then the slope would be lower. But the actual efficiency (how much protein is needed for a certain nitrogen balance) is higher. Therefore, the slope underestimates the efficiency. Wait, maybe B is correct. Because if the slope is calculated under standard conditions, but the adaptive metabolic demand means that the body uses protein more efficiently, then the actual efficiency is higher than what the slope suggests. Therefore, the slope underestimates the efficiency. So B would be correct. But I need to check other options.\n\nOption C: Variable adaptation between different N-balance studies is fully accounted for in the calculation of the safe individual protein requirement as EAR+2SD. The EAR is based on the average requirement, and the 2SD is to cover the variability. However, if adaptation varies between individuals, then the EAR might not account for that. But the safe individual requirement is usually set at EAR + 2SD to account for variability. So maybe C is correct. Wait, but the question is about the consequence of adaptive metabolic demand. So if adaptation varies between studies, would that variability be accounted for in the calculation? If the EAR is already based on data that includes variability, then adding 2SD might cover that. But I'm not sure if adaptation is considered in the calculation of EAR. The EAR is the average requirement, and the safe individual requirement (like the RNI) is EAR + 2SD. So if adaptation leads to variability in requirements, then the EAR might already account for that. So C could be correct. But the question is about the consequence of adaptive metabolic demand on the determination of minimum protein requirement. So if the variable adaptation between studies is considered, then C would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is incorrect because the EAR+2SD is not specifically for adaptation but for variability in requirements. So perhaps the answer is C.\n\nBut I need to think again. The question is about the consequence of adaptive metabolic demand. For example, if different studies have different adaptations (like some people adapt more than others), then when calculating the safe requirement, they use EAR + 2SD. So if the adaptive metabolic demand varies between individuals, then the EAR is the average, and 2SD would account for that variability. Therefore, C is correct. But I'm not sure if this is the case. Alternatively, the adaptive metabolic demand might not be considered in the EAR calculation. Wait, the EAR is based on the minimum requirement to meet the needs of the population, considering factors like growth, pregnancy, etc. So maybe the EAR already accounts for these adaptive demands. Therefore, the safe individual requirement (EAR + 2SD) would include the variability due to adaptation. Therefore, C is correct.\n\nBut earlier, I thought B might be correct. Let me try to recall. The nitrogen balance studies are used to determine protein requirements. However, if the body adapts, the nitrogen balance might change. For example, during growth, the body requires more protein. If the study doesn't account for the adaptation (like not considering growth), then the nitrogen balance might be lower, leading to an underestimation of the required protein. Therefore, the slope (which is the relationship between protein intake and nitrogen balance) might be underestimated. Wait, if the slope is the amount of protein needed to achieve a certain nitrogen balance, and adaptation requires more protein, then the slope would be higher. But the study might not account for adaptation, leading to a lower slope, which underestimates the efficiency (since more protein is needed). Wait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the slope refers to the rate of nitrogen retention per unit of protein intake. If the body adapts to be more efficient (i.e., uses protein more efficiently), then for the same intake, more nitrogen is retained. Therefore, the slope would be higher, implying higher efficiency. But the question says that the slope underestimates the efficiency. So if the slope is calculated in a study that does not account for adaptation, then the actual efficiency is higher, making the slope underestimate it. Therefore, B would be correct. But I'm not sure. \n\nThis is really tricky. Let me look for key points. The adaptive metabolic demand refers to the body's ability to adjust its protein needs based on physiological states. When determining minimum protein requirements, if adaptation is not considered, the studies might not accurately reflect the true requirements. For example, if a person is in a state of adaptation (like during growth or stress), they need more protein, but if the study doesn't account for this, the nitrogen balance might not show the needed intake. \n\nNitrogen balance studies measure the difference between intake and excretion. If the body adapts, the nitrogen retention might be different. The slope of the N-balance curve (which relates protein intake to nitrogen balance) could be affected. If the slope is calculated under normal conditions, but the person is in a state of adaptation, the slope might be different. If the slope is used to estimate protein efficiency, and adaptation leads to higher efficiency (less protein needed for the same nitrogen balance), then the slope would be lower. Wait, that might mean that the slope underestimates the efficiency. For example, if the slope is the amount of nitrogen retained per unit of protein, and with adaptation, the same protein intake leads to more nitrogen retention, then the slope would be higher. But if the study's slope is based on non-adapted conditions, then the actual efficiency (which is higher) would mean the slope is underestimated. So B says the slope underestimates efficiency. That would be correct. Therefore, B could be the answer.\n\nBut earlier, I thought C might be correct. Let me think again. The safe individual requirement is calculated as EAR + 2SD. This accounts for variability in requirements, including factors like age, gender, activity level, etc. If adaptation between different studies is variable, then the EAR is the average requirement, and adding 2SD would account for individual differences, including those due to adaptation. Therefore, C would be correct. But the question is about the consequence of adaptive metabolic demand. If the variable adaptation between studies is not fully accounted for, then C might not be correct. However, the standard method does use EAR + 2SD to account for variability. So C is correct. \n\nWait, but the question is about the consequence of adaptive metabolic demand. The adaptive metabolic demand is a factor that contributes to variability in protein requirements. Therefore, when calculating the safe requirement, using EAR + 2SD would account for that variability. Therefore, C is correct. However, I'm not sure if this is the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe C is incorrect because the adaptive metabolic demand is not considered in the calculation of EAR. The EAR is based on the average requirement, and the 2SD is to account for individual variation. If adaptation is a source of variation, then EAR + 2SD would account for that. So C is correct. \n\nBut I'm still torn between B and C. Let me try to recall some references. In nutrition, the nitrogen balance method is used to estimate protein requirements. However, adaptive metabolic demand can affect the results. For example, during growth, the body requires more protein, but if the study doesn't account for this, the nitrogen balance might not reflect the true requirement. \n\nThe slope of the nitrogen balance curve (protein intake vs. nitrogen balance) is used to estimate protein efficiency. If the body adapts to be more efficient (i.e., uses protein more effectively), then for the same intake, more nitrogen is retained, leading to a steeper slope. However, if the study is conducted without considering adaptation, the slope might be lower, which would mean the efficiency is higher than what the slope suggests. Therefore, the slope underestimates the efficiency. Hence, B would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the slope is steeper, it would indicate higher efficiency, so the slope does not underestimate. This is confusing. Maybe I need to think about the formula. Suppose the slope is (ΔN balance)/(Δprotein intake). If the body adapts to be more efficient, then for the same amount of protein, the nitrogen balance is higher. Therefore, the slope would be higher, indicating that the efficiency is better. So the slope actually reflects higher efficiency. Therefore, B is incorrect. \n\nIn that case, maybe B is incorrect. So what about C? If variable adaptation between studies is considered in the calculation of EAR + 2SD, then C is correct. Since the EAR is the average requirement, and 2SD accounts for variability, including adaptation, then C would be correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's B. \n\nWait, another angle: the adaptive metabolic demand means that the body's protein requirements can change based on physiological states. When conducting nitrogen balance studies, if adaptation is not considered, the results might not accurately reflect the true protein needs. This variability between studies could be accounted for in the calculation of the safe individual requirement using EAR + 2SD. Therefore, C is correct. \n\nBut the question is about the consequence of adaptive metabolic demand on the determination of minimum protein requirement. So the answer would be that variable adaptation is considered in the EAR + 2SD. Hence, C is correct. Therefore, the best answer is C.\n",

    "From what I remember,",
    "adaptive metabolic demand refers to the body's ability to adjust its protein needs based on physiological conditions,",
    "such as stress,",
    "growth, or changes in activity levels.",
    "For example, during pregnancy or illness,",
    "the body might require more protein to support tissue repair or growth,",
    "even if the person isn't eating more.",
    "Now, the question is about how this adaptation affects the determination of minimum protein requirements.",
    "Let's look at the answer choices one by one.",
    "Option A: Adaptation is fully accounted for in the design of nitrogen balance studies.",
    "Hmm.",
    "Nitrogen balance studies measure the difference between nitrogen intake and excretion.",
    "If the body adapts,",
    "maybe the required protein intake changes.",
    "But does the design of these studies account for adaptation?",
    "I think that nitrogen balance studies are done under controlled conditions,",
    "but they might not always account for individual variations in adaptation.",
    "So maybe A is incorrect because they might not fully account for it,",
    "especially if the study design doesn't consider varying metabolic demands.",
    "Option B: The adaptive metabolic demand means that the slope of N-balance studies underestimates the efficiency of protein utilization.",
    "Wait, the slope of N-balance studies...",
    "I'm a bit fuzzy here.",
    "Nitrogen balance can be measured as the amount of nitrogen retained.",
    "If the body adapts,",
    "maybe the efficiency of using protein",
    "(like how much protein is needed to maintain balance)",
    "changes.",
    "If the slope of the N-balance study is used to calculate protein efficiency,",
    "but adaptation leads to more efficient use,",
    "then maybe the slope would be lower.",
    "Wait, but if the body adapts,",
    "perhaps under the same protein intake,",
    "the nitrogen balance changes.",
    "So, if adaptation leads to more efficient utilization,",
    "then the slope",
    "(which might be the rate of nitrogen retention per protein intake)",
    "might be higher.",
    "So, if the slope underestimates the efficiency,",
    "that would mean that the actual efficiency is higher than what the slope suggests.",
    "But I'm not sure.",
    "Maybe this is a trick part.",
    "Need to think more.",
    "Option C: Variable adaptation between different N-balance studies is fully accounted for in the calculation of the safe individual protein requirement as EAR+2SD.",
    "The EAR",
    "(Estimated Average Requirement)",
    "is the intake level that meets the requirement of 50% of the population.",
    "The safe individual requirement is often set as EAR + 2SD (standard deviations) to account for variability.",
    "If there's variability in adaptation between studies,",
    "does that variability get accounted for in this calculation?",
    "Well, the EAR itself might already consider some variability.",
    "But if adaptation varies between individuals or studies,",
    "then using EAR + 2SD might account for that variability.",
    "But I'm not certain.",
    "Maybe the adaptive metabolic demand varies between individuals,",
    "so when calculating the safe requirement,",
    "you add 2SD to cover that variability.",
    "So maybe C is correct?",
    "But I need to check.",
    "Option D: Adaptation should not influence the interpretation of N-balance studies.",
    "That seems unlikely.",
    "Because if the body adapts,",
    "the nitrogen balance would change.",
    "For example, if someone is in a state of adaptation",
    "(like during growth or stress),",
    "their nitrogen balance might be different.",
    "So, adaptation should influence the interpretation.",
    "Therefore, D is probably incorrect.",
    "Going back to option B:",
    "If adaptive metabolic demand means that the body uses protein more efficiently,",
    "then the slope of the N-balance study",
    "(which might be the nitrogen retention per protein intake)",
    "would be steeper.",
    "But the question says that the slope underestimates the efficiency.",
    "Wait, if the slope is steeper,",
    "then the efficiency is higher.",
    "But if the slope is underestimated,",
    "then maybe the actual efficiency is higher than what the slope suggests.",
    "So if the body adapts,",
    "perhaps the efficiency is higher,",
    "but the study's slope underestimates it.",
    "That might mean that the slope is not accounting for the adaptation,",
    "hence underestimating the efficiency.",
    "So B could be correct.",
    "But I'm not sure.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the slope is the rate of nitrogen retention per unit of protein intake.",
    "If the body adapts to require less protein,",
    "then the slope",
    "(nitrogen balance per protein)",
    "might be higher",
    "(more retention for same intake),",
    "but the efficiency is higher.",
    "Wait, maybe the efficiency is measured as how much protein is needed to maintain balance.",
    "If adaptation leads to higher efficiency,",
    "then the same amount of protein would result in more nitrogen retention.",
    "Therefore, the slope",
    "(which might be the nitrogen balance per protein intake)",
    "would be steeper.",
    "But the question says that the slope underestimates the efficiency.",
    "So if the slope is steeper,",
    "then the efficiency is higher,",
    "but the slope might be higher,",
    "not underestimated.",
    "Therefore, maybe B is incorrect.",
    "Hmm, this is confusing.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the slope refers to the relationship between protein intake and nitrogen balance.",
    "If the body adapts,",
    "then for a given protein intake,",
    "the nitrogen balance would be higher (more retention),",
    "so the slope would be steeper.",
    "However, if the study uses a slope to estimate efficiency,",
    "but adaptation makes the efficiency higher (i.e.,",
    "less protein needed for the same nitrogen balance),",
    "then the slope would be higher.",
    "But the question says that the slope underestimates the efficiency.",
    "If the slope is calculated under normal conditions,",
    "but in reality,",
    "with adaptation, the efficiency is higher,",
    "then the slope would be lower.",
    "Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the formula.",
    "Let's say that the slope is the amount of nitrogen retained per unit of protein intake.",
    "If the body adapts to be more efficient,",
    "then for the same protein intake,",
    "more nitrogen is retained.",
    "So the slope would be higher,",
    "implying higher efficiency.",
    "However, if the study is doing a nitrogen balance study under conditions where adaptation is not considered,",
    "maybe the actual efficiency is higher,",
    "and the slope",
    "(which is measured in the study)",
    "might be lower because the study didn't account for adaptation.",
    "Wait, this is getting too tangled.",
    "Maybe I should think of an example.",
    "Suppose a person is in a state of adaptation",
    "(like during growth).",
    "They require more protein to maintain nitrogen balance.",
    "If you measure the nitrogen balance at a certain protein intake,",
    "you might find that the nitrogen balance is higher than expected.",
    "But if the study's slope is calculated based on standard conditions (without adaptation),",
    "then the slope would be lower.",
    "But the actual efficiency",
    "(how much protein is needed for a certain nitrogen balance)",
    "is higher.",
    "Therefore, the slope underestimates the efficiency.",
    "Wait, maybe B is correct.",
    "Because if the slope is calculated under standard conditions,",
    "but the adaptive metabolic demand means that the body uses protein more efficiently,",
    "then the actual efficiency is higher than what the slope suggests.",
    "Therefore, the slope underestimates the efficiency.",
    "So B would be correct.",
    "But I need to check other options.",
    "Option C: Variable adaptation between different N-balance studies is fully accounted for in the calculation of the safe individual protein requirement as EAR+2SD.",
    "The EAR is based on the average requirement,",
    "and the 2SD is to cover the variability.",
    "However, if adaptation varies between individuals,",
    "then the EAR might not account for that.",
    "But the safe individual requirement is usually set at EAR + 2SD to account for variability.",
    "So maybe C is correct.",
    "Wait, but the question is about the consequence of adaptive metabolic demand.",
    "So if adaptation varies between studies,",
    "would that variability be accounted for in the calculation?",
    "If the EAR is already based on data that includes variability,",
    "then adding 2SD might cover that.",
    "But I'm not sure if adaptation is considered in the calculation of EAR.",
    "The EAR is the average requirement,",
    "and the safe individual requirement",
    "(like the RNI)",
    "is EAR + 2SD.",
    "So if adaptation leads to variability in requirements,",
    "then the EAR might already account for that.",
    "So C could be correct.",
    "But the question is about the consequence of adaptive metabolic demand on the determination of minimum protein requirement.",
    "So if the variable adaptation between studies is considered,",
    "then C would be correct.",
    "Alternatively, maybe C is incorrect because the EAR+2SD is not specifically for adaptation but for variability in requirements.",
    "So perhaps the answer is C.",
    "But I need to think again.",
    "The question is about the consequence of adaptive metabolic demand.",
    "For example, if different studies have different adaptations",
    "(like some people adapt more than others),",
    "then when calculating the safe requirement,",
    "they use EAR + 2SD.",
    "So if the adaptive metabolic demand varies between individuals,",
    "then the EAR is the average,",
    "and 2SD would account for that variability.",
    "Therefore, C is correct.",
    "But I'm not sure if this is the case.",
    "Alternatively, the adaptive metabolic demand might not be considered in the EAR calculation.",
    "Wait, the EAR is based on the minimum requirement to meet the needs of the population,",
    "considering factors like growth,",
    "pregnancy, etc.",
    "So maybe the EAR already accounts for these adaptive demands.",
    "Therefore, the safe individual requirement",
    "(EAR + 2SD)",
    "would include the variability due to adaptation.",
    "Therefore, C is correct.",
    "But earlier, I thought B might be correct.",
    "Let me try to recall.",
    "The nitrogen balance studies are used to determine protein requirements.",
    "However, if the body adapts,",
    "the nitrogen balance might change.",
    "For example, during growth,",
    "the body requires more protein.",
    "If the study doesn't account for the adaptation",
    "(like not considering growth),",
    "then the nitrogen balance might be lower,",
    "leading to an underestimation of the required protein.",
    "Therefore, the slope",
    "(which is the relationship between protein intake and nitrogen balance)",
    "might be underestimated.",
    "Wait, if the slope is the amount of protein needed to achieve a certain nitrogen balance,",
    "and adaptation requires more protein,",
    "then the slope would be higher.",
    "But the study might not account for adaptation,",
    "leading to a lower slope,",
    "which underestimates the efficiency",
    "(since more protein is needed).",
    "Wait, I'm getting confused again.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the slope refers to the rate of nitrogen retention per unit of protein intake.",
    "If the body adapts to be more efficient (i.e.,",
    "uses protein more efficiently),",
    "then for the same intake,",
    "more nitrogen is retained.",
    "Therefore, the slope would be higher,",
    "implying higher efficiency.",
    "But the question says that the slope underestimates the efficiency.",
    "So if the slope is calculated in a study that does not account for adaptation,",
    "then the actual efficiency is higher,",
    "making the slope underestimate it.",
    "Therefore, B would be correct.",
    "But I'm not sure.",
    "This is really tricky.",
    "Let me look for key points.",
    "The adaptive metabolic demand refers to the body's ability to adjust its protein needs based on physiological states.",
    "When determining minimum protein requirements,",
    "if adaptation is not considered,",
    "the studies might not accurately reflect the true requirements.",
    "For example, if a person is in a state of adaptation",
    "(like during growth or stress),",
    "they need more protein,",
    "but if the study doesn't account for this,",
    "the nitrogen balance might not show the needed intake.",
    "Nitrogen balance studies measure the difference between intake and excretion.",
    "If the body adapts,",
    "the nitrogen retention might be different.",
    "The slope of the N-balance curve",
    "(which relates protein intake to nitrogen balance)",
    "could be affected.",
    "If the slope is calculated under normal conditions,",
    "but the person is in a state of adaptation,",
    "the slope might be different.",
    "If the slope is used to estimate protein efficiency,",
    "and adaptation leads to higher efficiency",
    "(less protein needed for the same nitrogen balance),",
    "then the slope would be lower.",
    "Wait, that might mean that the slope underestimates the efficiency.",
    "For example, if the slope is the amount of nitrogen retained per unit of protein,",
    "and with adaptation,",
    "the same protein intake leads to more nitrogen retention,",
    "then the slope would be higher.",
    "But if the study's slope is based on non-adapted conditions,",
    "then the actual efficiency",
    "(which is higher)",
    "would mean the slope is underestimated.",
    "So B says the slope underestimates efficiency.",
    "That would be correct.",
    "Therefore, B could be the answer.",
    "But earlier, I thought C might be correct.",
    "Let me think again.",
    "The safe individual requirement is calculated as EAR + 2SD.",
    "This accounts for variability in requirements,",
    "including factors like age,",
    "gender, activity level, etc.",
    "If adaptation between different studies is variable,",
    "then the EAR is the average requirement,",
