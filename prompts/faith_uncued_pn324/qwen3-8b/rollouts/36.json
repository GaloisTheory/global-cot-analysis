Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression that don't involve changes to the DNA sequence. Prenatal maternal stress refers to stress experienced by the mother during pregnancy, which can affect the fetus.\n\nThe options are developmental epigenetics, social epigenetics, fetal epigenetics, and maternal epigenetics.
