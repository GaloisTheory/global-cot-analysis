  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this question. So, the scenario is about a state law that requires vacant public school buildings to be sold at auction to the highest bidder. Then, a church wants to get a bigger facility for its school. The city's school board is proposing a new state law that would allow them to sell a vacant public school building to the church at a price below fair market value, specifically for use as their school. The question is whether this new law would be constitutional.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relevant constitutional provisions. The main ones here would be the First Amendment, particularly the establishment clause, and the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. Also, there's the issue of government selling property and whether that's allowed under these clauses.\n\nSo, the original state law requires auctioning at highest bid. The proposed new law would allow selling below market value to the church. The church is a religious institution, so there's a potential for an establishment of religion issue here. But the question is about the constitutionality of the new law.\n\nLet me break it down. The original law is about selling at auction, which is a competitive process. The new law would allow the school board to sell the building to the church at a lower price. Now, if the school board is acting within their authority, perhaps they have the power to sell surplus property. But the church's use is for religious purposes. \n\nUnder the First Amendment, the government can't establish religion. However, there's a distinction between government action that directly supports religion and actions that are neutral. If the law allows selling to the church without competitive bidding, maybe it's a form of preferential treatment. However, if the law is neutral and the church is just one of many potential buyers, maybe it's okay. But if the law is specifically targeting religious institutions, then it might be an establishment clause violation. \n\nWait, but the question is about the new law that would authorize the school board to sell the building to the church. So, if the law is only allowing this specific sale, maybe the school board is using their authority to sell surplus property. But the problem is the price being below fair market value. That might be a problem because the original law requires auctioning, which is a competitive process. If the school board is allowed to bypass that and sell to the church at a lower price, maybe that's a violation of equal protection. Because the law allows the school board to sell to the church under different terms than other buyers. \n\nBut then, the school board is a public entity, so maybe they have the authority to sell surplus property. But if they are doing it in a way that's not competitive, maybe that's a problem. The original law requires auctioning, but the new law would allow selling below market value. So, maybe the new law is not in line with the existing state law. However, the question is about whether the new law would be constitutional. \n\nAlternatively, if the new law is passed, it's a state law. So, the school board's action would be under the new law. The key here is whether the new law violates the establishment clause or equal protection. \n\nLooking at the answer options. Option B says it would violate the establishment clause. But if the law is allowing the sale to a religious institution, but the school board is acting in a neutral way, maybe not. However, the church is being sold at a lower price, which might be a specific benefit. \n\nAlternatively, if the law allows the sale to the church, but the sale is for a religious use, that could be seen as an establishment of religion. However, the Supreme Court has held in cases like Lemon v. Kurtzman that the government can't advance religion, but there's also cases where government provides services to religious institutions as long as it's neutral. \n\nBut in this case, the sale is to a specific religious institution. The school board is selling the building to the church. If the law allows that, but the church is using it for religious purposes, that could be seen as the government endorsing religion. However, if the school board is just selling property, perhaps they can do so to any entity. But if the law is specifically allowing the sale to the church, that might be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, the new law might be a general law that allows the school board to sell surplus property to any buyer, not just the church. However, the scenario says the church is seeking to acquire the building for its school, so the law is specifically about selling to the church. Wait, the question says that the city's school board proposed a new state law that would authorize it to sell a vacant building to the church. So the law is specifically about selling to the church. That seems like a targeted action, which might be an establishment of religion. \n\nBut maybe the law is only allowing the sale to the church for educational purposes. Wait, the church is using it as a school. So maybe the school board is selling the building to the church for educational use, which is a public purpose? But the church is a religious institution. \n\nAlternatively, the school board might be allowed to sell the building to any organization that uses it for educational purposes. But the problem is that the law is specifically directed at the church. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be B, which says it's an establishment of religion. But I need to think about the difference between direct and indirect support. \n\nThen, looking at option D: Yes, because the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church. So if the sale is just for the church to use as a school, maybe that's not a substantial support. But if the school is a religious school, then the government is supporting religious activities. \n\nAlternatively, the First Amendment's establishment clause prohibits the government from establishing religion. However, if the school board is selling property to a religious institution for a secular purpose (like education), maybe that's permissible. But the church's school might be considered a religious activity. \n\nBut the Supreme Court in cases like Everson v. Board of Education held that the government can provide services to religious institutions as long as it's not directly supporting religion. However, in other cases, like the case involving parochial schools, the Court has said that government funding for religious schools is problematic. \n\nIn this case, the school board is selling a building to the church, which is for their school. If the school is a religious school, then the government is providing a facility for religious education. That might be seen as government support of religion. \n\nBut the answer options need to be evaluated. Let's look again. The original law requires auctioning. The new law would allow the school board to sell to the church at a lower price. If the new law is specifically allowing the sale to the church, that would be a targeted action. If the law is a new state law that authorizes the school board to sell the building to the church (for use as a school), that could be an establishment of religion. Therefore, answer B would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the law is neutral, and the school board is just selling the building to the church because they are the highest bidder, but the sale is at a lower price, then that might be an equal protection issue. But the original law requires auctioning, and the new law allows selling below market value. So the new law might be violating the equal protection clause if it allows the school board to sell to the church without competitive bidding. \n\nHmm. The original law requires auctioning, so the new law is a different approach. The question is whether the new law would be constitutional. If the new law allows the school board to sell the building to the church at a lower price, that might be a violation of equal protection. For example, if the school board can sell to the church at a lower price, but not to others, that's a preferential treatment. So the new law would allow the school board to sell to the church in a way that's not subject to the auction, which might be unequal. \n\nSo answer A says it violates the equal protection clause. \n\nBut answer B is about the establishment clause. \n\nSo which one is correct? \n\nThe key is whether the law is being used to favor the church. If the school board is allowed to sell the building to the church for a price below market value, that could be a form of state action that is preferential. But if the law is a general law that allows the sale to any organization, then maybe it's not. However, the scenario says the church is seeking to acquire the building for its school. The law is specifically for the church. \n\nAlternatively, the law is a new state law that authorizes the school board to sell the building to the church, which is a specific entity. That could be a targeted action. So if the law is specifically about the church, then it's a form of establishment. \n\nBut the school board is a public agency. When they sell property, they can do so to any entity. If the law allows them to sell to the church, but not to others, then that's a problem. However, the law might be part of a general policy. For example, if the school board is allowed to sell surplus property to any entity, but the church is a specific case. \n\nAlternatively, the law is a special law that authorizes the sale to the church. So, if the state law is allowing the school board to sell the building to the church, that would be a specific act, which might be an establishment. \n\nHowever, the answer choices are (A) and (B) as possible. \n\nAnother angle: the First Amendment's establishment clause. The government cannot establish religion. But if the school board is selling a building to a church for use as a school, that's a public use. However, the church is using it for religious education, which is a religious activity. So the government is supporting religious activities. \n\nBut the Supreme Court in cases like the 1984 case of Lee v. Weisman held that government can't force religious speech, but in other cases, like the 2005 case of McCreary County v. ACLU, the Court struck down a law allowing religious displays in public schools. \n\nIn general, the government can't favor religion over other groups. However, if the sale is for a secular purpose, like education (even if the school is religious), maybe that's okay. \n\nBut the problem here is that the church is using the building for its school. If the school is a religious school, then the government is supporting religious activities. \n\nBut the answer D says that the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities. If the sale is for the church to use as a school, which is a public function (education), then maybe the support is not substantial. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be B. \n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me think again. \n\nThe original state law requires auctioning the building to the highest bidder. The new law would allow the school board to sell the building to the church at a price below fair market value. \n\nIf the new law is passed, it's a state law. The school board is acting under this law. \n\nIf the law allows the school board to sell the building to the church, that's a specific action. If the school board is doing this for the church's use as a school, that's a religious use. \n\nBut the school board is a public entity. If they sell the building to the church, it's a government action. \n\nThe establishment clause prohibits the government from establishing religion. However, the government can provide services to religious institutions, as long as it's not done in a way that's seen as endorsing religion. \n\nBut in this case, the government is selling the building to the church. If the sale is for the church to use as a school, which is a public function, maybe that's not a direct endorsement. However, if the school is a religious school, then the government is supporting religious activities. \n\nBut the Supreme Court in the case of Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972) allowed religious exemptions from compulsory education laws. However, that's different from the government providing facilities. \n\nAnother case: in the 1990 case of United States v. Lee, the Court upheld a law allowing a religious organization to use a government facility. But that was about a religious organization using a government facility. \n\nBut in this case, the government is selling the building to the church. If the sale is for the church to use as a school, then the government is providing a facility for religious education, which could be seen as government support of religion. \n\nBut the answer would depend on whether the law's purpose is to support religion. If the law is neutral and allows for the sale to any entity, then the school's use of the building could be for secular purposes. However, if the law is specifically targeting the church, then it's an establishment. \n\nBut the new law is proposed by the school board to sell to the church. The question is whether the law itself is constitutional. \n\nSo if the law is a general law allowing the school board to sell surplus property to any buyer, then it's okay. But if the law is specifically for the church, then it's an establishment. \n\nBut the question says the city's school board proposed a new state law that would authorize it to sell a vacant public school building to the church. So the law is specifically about selling to the church. \n\nTherefore, this specific sale to the church might be an establishment of religion. Hence, answer B. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be A, if the law allows selling to the church at a lower price without competitive bidding, which might be an equal protection issue. \n\nBut the original law requires auctioning, but the new law allows the school board to sell to the church at a lower price. If the school board can do this, but not others, then it's unequal. However, the new law is a state law. So if the new law is passed, it would allow the school board to sell the building to the church (maybe even the school board is part of the government, so they can sell the property to the church). \n\nBut if the law is passed, it would be a state law. If the school board is allowed to sell the building to the church, maybe that's allowed under the state law. But the question is about the constitutionality. \n\nSo, the key points are: \n\n- Does the law violate the establishment clause by favoring the church? \n\n- Does it violate the equal protection clause by allowing unequal treatment? \n\nIf the law is a general law that allows selling to any buyer, then the answer would be different. But the question says the law is specifically about the church. \n\nSo, the law is specifically authorizing the sale to the church. Therefore, it's a targeted action, which might be an establishment. \n\nBut the answer options don't have an option that says \"the law is specifically targeting the church, thus violating the establishment clause.\" Instead, answer B says \"transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances would constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\" \n\nSo answer B would be correct. \n\nBut wait, the school board is selling the building for use as a school, which is a secular purpose, maybe? Or is it a religious purpose? If the church's school is a religious school, then the government is supporting religion. \n\nBut the Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman established the three-prong test: \n\n1. The government action must have a secular purpose. \n\n2. The primary effect must not advance or inhibit religion. \n\n3. The government action must not foster excessive entanglement with religion. \n\nIf the sale is for a secular purpose (like providing a public education facility), maybe that's okay. But if the school is a religious school, then the government is supporting religion. \n\nBut the answer B says it's an establishment. \n\nAlternatively, answer D says that the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church. \n\nSo, if the sale is for the church to use as a school (which is a secular purpose), then it's okay. But if the school is a religious school, then the government is supporting religious activities. \n\nThis is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be B. Because the church is a religious institution. Even if the use is for a school, the government is giving a benefit to a religious organization. \n\nBut the Supreme Court in cases like the 1993 case of Employment Division v. Smith, held that the government can generally apply laws neutrally to religious practices. But that's about laws that neutrally apply to all, not about specific benefits. \n\nIn the case of the 2005 case of McCreary County v. ACLU, the Court struck down a law allowing religious displays in public schools. \n\nIn the case of the 2000 case of Van Orden v. Perry, the Court upheld a Ten Commandments display in a state capitol, saying it was part of a historical tradition but not a religious endorsement. \n\nSo, the key is whether the government is endorsing religion. If the school board is selling the building to the church, and the church uses it for a religious school, that might be seen as endorsement. But if the school is a public school, then it's different. \n\nBut the church is using it as its school, which is a private religious school. \n\nSo, the government is selling a public asset to a religious organization for a religious purpose. That could be an establishment of religion. \n\nTherefore, answer B would be correct. \n\nHowever, answer D says that the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities. If the sale is for the church to use as a school, which is a secular purpose, then maybe the law is not supporting religious activities. \n\nBut the church is a religious institution, so even if they are using it for education, it's still a religious activity. \n\nThis is tricky. \n\nAnother angle: the school board is selling the building to the church. The school board is a public entity. The sale is a transfer of property. If the law is passed, the school board can sell the building to the church. The law's purpose is to allow the sale. \n\nIf the law is neutral and the school board is allowed to sell to any buyer, then it's okay. But if the law is specifically targeting the church, then it's an establishment. \n\nBut the question states that the city's school board proposed a new state law that would authorize it to sell the building to the church. So the law is specifically about selling to the church. \n\nTherefore, this law is not neutral. It's a special law. Thus, it might be an establishment of religion. \n\nTherefore, answer B. \n\nBut answer A says it violates equal protection. If the law allows the school board to sell the building to the church at a lower price without competitive bidding, that's a form of preferential treatment, which would violate equal protection. \n\nBut the original law requires auctioning. The new law would allow the school board to sell to the church at a lower price. If the school board is allowed to do this, then it's a special case. But does that violate equal protection? \n\nThe equal protection clause requires that the law be applied equally to all. If the law allows the school board to sell to the church, but not to others, that's a violation. However, the school board is a public entity, and they might have the authority to sell surplus property. \n\nBut if the law is passed, it would allow the school board to sell to the church at a lower price. So, if the law is passed, it would be a specific exception to the auction law. But if the law is written to allow the school board to sell to the church for educational use, then it's a specific exception. \n\nThis is a complex issue. \n\nIn the absence of a clear answer, perhaps the best approach is to evaluate the answer choices. \n\nOption B says it's an establishment of religion. \n\nOption D says it's not substantially supporting the religious activities. \n\nIn the case of the Supreme Court, the establishment clause prohibits government action that advances religion. If the law allows the sale to the church for their school, which is a religious use, then it's advancing religion. \n\nBut if the school is a public school, then it's different. However, the church is a religious institution, so the use is for religious purposes. \n\nTherefore, the law might be an establishment of religion. So answer B. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Another thought: the First Amendment's establishment clause is interpreted to prohibit government from establishing religion, but it doesn't prohibit the government from providing facilities to religious institutions for secular purposes. For example, if a government builds a building and sells it to a religious institution for use as a school, it's a secular use. \n\nHowever, the church is using it for religious purposes. So if the building is used for religious activities, it's supporting religion. \n\nBut the Supreme Court in cases like the 2002 case of Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, held that government-funded school voucher programs that allow parents to use the funds for religious schools are constitutional, as long as the government doesn't directly fund the religious activities. \n\nIn that case, the government's action was neutral, and the choice was made by the parents. \n\nSo, in this case, the government is selling a building to the church, and the church is using it for their school. If the school is a religious school, then the government is supporting religion. But if the school is a public school, then it's different. \n\nThe question says the church is using it for its school, which suggests it's a religious school. \n\nTherefore, the law would be an establishment of religion, making answer B correct. \n\nBut answer D says that the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities. If the sale is for the church to use as a school, which is a secular purpose, then maybe not. But if the church is using it for religious activities, then it is. \n\nThis is very ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be A. Because the law allows the sale without competitive bidding, which is a different treatment. \n\nBut the original law requires auctioning. The new law allows the school board to sell to the church at a lower price. If the law is passed, it would give the school board the authority to sell to the church at a price below market value. This would be a preferential treatment, which could be an equal protection violation. \n\nBut the school board is a public entity. If they have the authority to sell surplus property, they might have the discretion to do so. However, the original law requires auctioning, which is a competitive process. The new law would allow the sale to the church without auctioning. If the school board is allowed to do this, it's a different standard. \n\nBut if the school board is allowed to sell the building to the church without auction, that's a preferential treatment compared to other bidders. Hence, violating equal protection. \n\nTherefore, answer A would be correct. \n\nSo now I'm torn between A and B. \n\nThe question is whether the law is constitutional. The original law requires auction, but the new law allows selling to the church at a lower price. \n\nIf the new law is passed, it's a state law. If the school board is authorized by the state to sell to the church, then the law is a state law. \n\nBut the equal protection clause requires that the law applies equally. If the law allows the school board to sell to the church, but not to others, that's a violation. \n\nBut the new law might be a special law that allows the school board to sell to the church for a specific purpose. \n\nHowever, the equal protection clause would require that the law be applied in a neutral way. \n\nAlternatively, if the law is a general law that allows the sale to any buyer, then it's okay. But the question says the new law is specifically for the church. \n\nSo, the answer is either A or B. \n\nIn the absence of more information, but based on the answer choices, answer B is about the establishment clause. \n\nBut the sale is to a religious institution for a school, which might be a secular use. \n\nBut in the case of the school being a religious school, the government is supporting religion. \n\nBut the Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman said that the government can't have a purpose of advancing religion. \n\nIf the purpose of the law is to provide the church with a facility for their school, then that's advancing religion. \n\nTherefore, the law would be unconstitutional under the establishment clause. \n\nSo answer B. \n\nBut I'm still not 100% sure. \n\nAnother angle: the school board is a public entity. They can sell property to any entity, but if the law is passed to allow selling to the church, that's a specific case. \n\nBut since the original law requires auctioning, the new law would allow the school board to sell without auctioning. This is a different treatment. \n\nSo, the equal protection clause would be violated if the school board is allowed to sell to the church at a lower price without auctioning, but not to others. \n\nThus, answer A. \n\nBut the question is about the law being constitutional. So, the new law would allow the school board to sell to the church at a lower price. If other bidders are not allowed to compete, that's a violation of equal protection. \n\nTherefore, answer A. \n\nBut the answer choices are A and B. \n\nIn the absence of clear information, I think the correct answer is B. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the original law is a state law requiring auctioning. The new law is a state law that authorizes the school board to sell to the church at a lower price. \n\nIf the new law is passed, it would allow the school board to sell the building to the church for use as a school. \n\nIf the school board is allowed to do this, does this violate the establishment clause? \n\nIf the law is passed, it's a state law. The school board is acting as a public entity. \n\nIf the school board sells the building to the church for use as a school, and the school is a religious school, then the government is supporting religion. \n\nBut if the school is a public school, then it's not. \n\nBut the question says the church is using the building for its school, which is a religious school. \n\nThus, the law is allowing the sale to the church for religious use. This would be an establishment of religion. \n\nTherefore, answer B is correct. \n\nBut the answer D says that the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church. If the sale is for the church to use as a school, then the government is providing a facility for the church's educational activities. If the school is a religious school, then it's supporting religion. \n\nSo, answer B is correct. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (B).\n",

    "The new law would allow the school board to sell to the church at a lower price.",
    "If the new law is specifically allowing the sale to the church, that would be a targeted action.",
    "If the law is a new state law that authorizes the school board to sell the building to the church (for use as a school), that could be an establishment of religion.",
    "Therefore, answer B would be correct.",
    "Alternatively, if the law is neutral, and the school board is just selling the building to the church because they are the highest bidder, but the sale is at a lower price, then that might be an equal protection issue.",
    "But the original law requires auctioning, and the new law allows selling below market value.",
    "So the new law might be violating the equal protection clause if it allows the school board to sell to the church without competitive bidding.",
    "Hmm.",
    "The original law requires auctioning, so the new law is a different approach.",
    "The question is whether the new law would be constitutional.",
    "If the new law allows the school board to sell the building to the church at a lower price, that might be a violation of equal protection.",
    "For example, if the school board can sell to the church at a lower price, but not to others, that's a preferential treatment.",
    "So the new law would allow the school board to sell to the church in a way that's not subject to the auction, which might be unequal.",
    "So answer A says it violates the equal protection clause.",
    "But answer B is about the establishment clause.",
    "So which one is correct?",
    "The key is whether the law is being used to favor the church.",
    "If the school board is allowed to sell the building to the church for a price below market value, that could be a form of state action that is preferential.",

    "The law is specifically for the church.",
    "Alternatively, the law is a new state law that authorizes the school board to sell the building to the church, which is a specific entity.",
    "That could be a targeted action.",
    "So if the law is specifically about the church, then it's a form of establishment.",
    "But the school board is a public agency.",
    "When they sell property, they can do so to any entity.",
    "If the law allows them to sell to the church, but not to others, then that's a problem.",
    "However, the law might be part of a general policy.",
    "For example, if the school board is allowed to sell surplus property to any entity, but the church is a specific case.",
    "Alternatively, the law is a special law that authorizes the sale to the church.",
    "So, if the state law is allowing the school board to sell the building to the church, that would be a specific act, which might be an establishment.",

    "The government cannot establish religion.",
    "But if the school board is selling a building to a church for use as a school, that's a public use.",
    "However, the church is using it for religious education, which is a religious activity.",
    "So the government is supporting religious activities.",

    "However, if the school is a religious school, then the government is supporting religious activities.",
    "But the Supreme Court in the case of Wisconsin v.",
    "Yoder (1972) allowed religious exemptions from compulsory education laws.",
    "However, that's different from the government providing facilities.",
    "Another case: in the 1990 case of United States v.",
    "Lee, the Court upheld a law allowing a religious organization to use a government facility.",
    "But that was about a religious organization using a government facility.",
    "But in this case, the government is selling the building to the church.",
    "If the sale is for the church to use as a school, then the government is providing a facility for religious education, which could be seen as government support of religion.",
    "But the answer would depend on whether the law's purpose is to support religion.",
    "If the law is neutral and allows for the sale to any entity, then the school's use of the building could be for secular purposes.",
    "However, if the law is specifically targeting the church, then it's an establishment.",
    "But the new law is proposed by the school board to sell to the church.",
    "The question is whether the law itself is constitutional.",

    "But if the law is specifically for the church, then it's an establishment.",
    "But the question says the city's school board proposed a new state law that would authorize it to sell a vacant public school building to the church.",

    "But the original law requires auctioning, but the new law allows the school board to sell to the church at a lower price.",

    "But if the law is passed, it would be a state law.",
    "If the school board is allowed to sell the building to the church, maybe that's allowed under the state law.",
    "But the question is about the constitutionality.",
    "So, the key points are:",
    "- Does the law violate the establishment clause by favoring the church?",
    "- Does it violate the equal protection clause by allowing unequal treatment?",
    "If the law is a general law that allows selling to any buyer, then the answer would be different.",
    "But the question says the law is specifically about the church.",
    "So, the law is specifically authorizing the sale to the church.",

    "But if the school is a religious school, then the government is supporting religious activities.",
    "This is getting complicated.",
    "Alternatively, the answer might be B.",
    "Because the church is a religious institution.",
    "Even if the use is for a school, the government is giving a benefit to a religious organization.",
    "But the Supreme Court in cases like the 1993 case of Employment Division v.",
    "Smith, held that the government can generally apply laws neutrally to religious practices.",
    "But that's about laws that neutrally apply to all, not about specific benefits.",

    "ACLU, the Court struck down a law allowing religious displays in public schools.",
    "In the case of the 2000 case of Van Orden v.",
    "Perry, the Court upheld a Ten Commandments display in a state capitol, saying it was part of a historical tradition but not a religious endorsement.",
    "So, the key is whether the government is endorsing religion.",
    "If the school board is selling the building to the church, and the church uses it for a religious school, that might be seen as endorsement.",
    "But if the school is a public school, then it's different.",
    "But the church is using it as its school, which is a private religious school.",
    "So, the government is selling a public asset to a religious organization for a religious purpose.",
    "That could be an establishment of religion.",
    "Therefore, answer B would be correct.",

    "If the sale is for the church to use as a school, which is a secular purpose, then maybe the law is not supporting religious activities.",

    "This is tricky.",
    "Another angle: the school board is selling the building to the church.",
    "The school board is a public entity.",
    "The sale is a transfer of property.",

    "Therefore, this law is not neutral.",
    "It's a special law.",

    "The new law would allow the school board to sell to the church at a lower price.",
    "If the school board is allowed to do this, then it's a special case.",

    "If the law allows the school board to sell to the church, but not to others, that's a violation.",
    "However, the school board is a public entity, and they might have the authority to sell surplus property.",
    "But if the law is passed, it would allow the school board to sell to the church at a lower price.",
    "So, if the law is passed, it would be a specific exception to the auction law.",
    "But if the law is written to allow the school board to sell to the church for educational use, then it's a specific exception.",
    "This is a complex issue.",
    "In the absence of a clear answer, perhaps the best approach is to evaluate the answer choices.",
    "Option B says it's an establishment of religion.",
    "Option D says it's not substantially supporting the religious activities.",
    "In the case of the Supreme Court, the establishment clause prohibits government action that advances religion.",
    "If the law allows the sale to the church for their school, which is a religious use, then it's advancing religion.",

    "But I'm not sure.",
    "Another thought: the First Amendment's establishment clause is interpreted to prohibit government from establishing religion, but it doesn't prohibit the government from providing facilities to religious institutions for secular purposes.",
    "For example, if a government builds a building and sells it to a religious institution for use as a school, it's a secular use.",
    "However, the church is using it for religious purposes.",
    "So if the building is used for religious activities, it's supporting religion.",
    "But the Supreme Court in cases like the 2002 case of Zelman v.",

    "In that case, the government's action was neutral, and the choice was made by the parents.",
    "So, in this case, the government is selling a building to the church, and the church is using it for their school.",
    "If the school is a religious school, then the government is supporting religion.",
    "But if the school is a public school, then it's different.",
    "The question says the church is using it for its school, which suggests it's a religious school.",
