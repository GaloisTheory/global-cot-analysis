  "cot_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out which answer choice is correct for the question about the Leiter International Performance Scale. Let me start by recalling what I know about this scale.\n\nFirst, the Leiter International Performance Scale is a type of intelligence test. I remember that some intelligence tests are designed for specific populations. For example, some tests might be used for children with certain disabilities or for different age groups. \n\nThe question is asking which group this scale would be most useful for measuring intelligence. The options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, or adults who are mentally retarded. Wait, \"mentally retarded\" is an outdated term; the current term is intellectual disability. But I'll go with the given terms.\n\nI think the Leiter scale is known for being a nonverbal test. That means it doesn't rely on language, which could be important for people with hearing or visual impairments. Also, nonverbal tests are often used for young children who can't yet speak well or for those who have language barriers. \n\nSo, let's break down each option. Option A: adults with visual impairments. If the test is nonverbal, maybe it's suitable, but I'm not sure if there are other considerations. Option B: children under two. Very young children might not be able to take standard intelligence tests because they haven't developed the necessary cognitive skills. However, some tests like the Bayley Scales are used for infants, but I don't know if Leiter is one of them. Option C: children with hearing impairments. Again, nonverbal tests could be good here because they don't require spoken language. Option D: adults with intellectual disabilities. These individuals might have trouble with verbal tests, so a nonverbal test could be more appropriate. \n\nWait, but the Leiter scale is specifically mentioned as a performance scale. I think it's designed to assess intelligence without relying on verbal responses. So maybe it's used for people who can't take traditional verbal tests. But which of the options fits best?\n\nChildren under two (B) might be too young for any standardized test. The Leiter scale might not be intended for such young children. Children with hearing impairments (C) could benefit from a nonverbal test, but maybe there's another test more suited. Adults with mental retardation (D) – the term is outdated, but assuming the question is using that, then nonverbal tests are used for people with intellectual disabilities. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter International Performance Scale is known for being a nonverbal, culture-fair test. It's often used for children and adults who have language barriers or learning disabilities. However, for very young children, maybe other scales are more appropriate. \n\nBut the answer choices include children under two (B). If the Leiter scale is for younger children, perhaps? Or maybe not. I think the Leiter scale is more commonly used for children with developmental delays or those who cannot take verbal tests, but not necessarily for the youngest. \n\nAlternatively, the key point might be that the Leiter scale is a performance scale, which is nonverbal, so it's useful for those who have hearing or visual impairments (since they can't use verbal components), but also for children who are too young to have developed language. However, children under two might not be suitable for any standard IQ test. \n\nWait, the Leiter scale's primary purpose is to measure intelligence in children with developmental disabilities, including those who are nonverbal. But the options include adults with visual impairments (A) and adults with intellectual disabilities (D). Which is more likely? \n\nHmm. Since the scale is called \"International Performance Scale,\" it might be designed for various populations, including those with sensory impairments. But I need to think about which answer is more correct based on standard testing practices. \n\nAnother angle: the Leiter scale is considered a better alternative for children with language disorders or those who are culturally or linguistically diverse. So for children with hearing impairments (C), since they might not have verbal skills, a nonverbal test would be better. Similarly, children with visual impairments (A) would also benefit from a nonverbal test. However, the answer choices might have only one correct answer. \n\nWait, the original question says \"most useful for measuring the intelligence of.\" So which group is the Leiter scale primarily designed for? From what I recall, the Leiter scale is used for assessing cognitive abilities in children with disabilities, especially those who can't take traditional verbal tests. But children under two might not be able to perform tasks required by the test. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter International Performance Scale is known for being suitable for bilingual children and those with limited language ability. So for children with hearing impairments (C), since they may have limited or no spoken language, this test would be useful. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: the Leiter scale is sometimes used for evaluating children with intellectual disabilities, but the answer choice D is adults with mental retardation. However, the Leiter scale might be more commonly used for children rather than adults. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be B, children under two. Wait, but I think that the Leiter scale is not typically used for such young children. Maybe the answer is C, children with hearing impairments, because the test is nonverbal. \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me try to check my memory. The Leiter International Performance Scale is a nonverbal intelligence test that is designed to assess cognitive functioning in children and adults who have language limitations. It's often used for children with developmental disabilities, including those with hearing impairments, as it doesn't rely on verbal communication. Therefore, for children with hearing impairments (C), the test would be useful. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be D, adults with intellectual disabilities. But I think the Leiter scale is more commonly associated with children. \n\nWait, the Leiter scale has versions for different age ranges, including preschoolers. So maybe for children with hearing impairments (C) who are in preschool age, the scale is useful. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be B, but I don't think that's right. The Leiter scale is for children starting at around 2 years old, perhaps. \n\nGiven that the options are A, B, C, D. \n\nIf the test is nonverbal, then children with hearing impairments (C) and adults with visual impairments (A) could both benefit. However, the Leiter scale is more often used for children, so C might be more correct. \n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the answer could be B, but I think that's less likely. \n\nWait, another angle: the Leiter International Performance Scale was developed to be used with children who have language deficits, such as those with autism or hearing impairment. Therefore, option C would be correct. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (C).",
