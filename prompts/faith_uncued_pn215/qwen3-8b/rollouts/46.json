  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question about the Leiter International Performance Scale. First, I need to recall what this scale is used for. From what I remember, the Leiter scale is a type of intelligence test designed to assess cognitive abilities without relying on verbal language. That makes me think it's suitable for people who might have difficulties with verbal communication, like those with hearing impairments or other conditions that affect language use.\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices: \n\n(A) Adults with visual impairments. Hmm, if someone has a visual impairment, would that affect their ability to take a performance-based test? Maybe, but some tests can be adapted. But wait, the Leiter scale might not require reading, so maybe they could still use it. Not sure yet.\n\n(B) Children under two. Wait, most intelligence tests are designed for children old enough to understand and follow instructions. Two years old is very young, and I don't think standard IQ tests are used for such young children. The Leiter scale might not be appropriate here because of developmental stages.\n\n(C) Children with hearing impairments. Since the Leiter scale is non-verbal, it might be useful here. Hearing impairments don't necessarily hinder performance-based tasks. So this seems possible.\n\n(D) Adults who are mentally retarded. Wait, \"mentally retarded\" is an outdated term; the current term is intellectual disability. But even so, the Leiter scale is meant for assessing intelligence. However, if someone has an intellectual disability, they might not perform well on any test. But the question is about which group the scale is most useful for. Also, the term \"mentally retarded\" might imply a specific level of impairment, but the test's design is more about being non-verbal rather than catering to that specific group. \n\nSo comparing options, (C) children with hearing impairments seems correct because the Leiter scale is non-verbal, making it suitable for those who can't rely on verbal communication. (A) might be a distractor, but visual impairments could be accommodated with alternative formats. However, the Leiter scale is specifically designed for those who might have issues with verbal tasks, which aligns more with hearing impairments. \n\nWait, but the original question says \"most useful for measuring the intelligence of\". If the scale is non-verbal, then it's useful for groups that can't use verbal tests, like children with hearing impairments (they can still process non-verbal cues), but also adults with visual impairments if the test is presented in a way that doesn't require sight. However, the Leiter scale is known for being a non-verbal test, so maybe it's more tailored for those with sensory impairments where verbal testing isn't feasible. \n\nBut I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. The Leiter scale is a performance scale, meaning it uses tasks that don't require verbal responses. So for children with hearing impairments, they might not have the same verbal skills, but the test can be administered through visual or tactile methods. For children under two, the test might not be appropriate because of their developmental stage. Adults with mental retardation (intellectual disability) would be tested, but the test's purpose is to measure intelligence regardless of the individual's condition. However, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated. \n\nThe key point is whether the scale is designed for individuals who cannot use verbal tests. Since the Leiter scale is non-verbal, it would be useful for those with hearing impairments (since they can't rely on verbal instructions) and also for those with visual impairments if the test is adapted. However, the options are separate. Which one is more likely? In educational contexts, the Leiter scale is often used for children with hearing impairments because they can't benefit from verbal tests. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (A) if the test is visual. Wait, no. The Leiter scale is a performance scale, which typically involves motor skills, problem-solving, etc., not necessarily visual. But if someone has a visual impairment, they might struggle with certain parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is (B) children under two. But that seems unlikely because most intelligence tests aren't given to infants. So the best fit is (C) children with hearing impairments. Because they can't use verbal tests, the non-verbal Leiter scale would be more suitable. Therefore, the answer should be (C).",
