  "cot_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out which answer choice the Leiter International Performance Scale is most useful for measuring intelligence. Let me start by recalling what I know about this scale.\n\nFirst, the Leiter International Performance Scale, also known as the Leiter-R, is a type of intelligence test. From what I remember, it's designed to be nonverbal, which means it doesn't rely on language or reading skills. That makes it suitable for people who might have difficulties with verbal communication, such as those with hearing impairments or visual impairments. But wait, the options here are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, and adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nWait, the Leiter-R is often used with younger children, right? Because some tests are not appropriate for very young kids. But the question mentions children under two. Hmm. Also, the Leiter-R is known to be a performance-based test, which means it uses tasks that require motor skills, problem-solving, etc., rather than verbal responses. So maybe it's good for children who can't talk yet, like under two? But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe it's more for children with hearing impairments because they can't rely on verbal instructions. Wait, but the test is nonverbal, so maybe both visual and hearing impaired individuals could use it. However, the age group is a factor here.\n\nWait, let me think again. The Leiter-R is typically administered to children aged 2 to 16, right? So children under two (option B) might not be suitable because the test is designed for older children. But then, maybe there's a version for younger ages? Or perhaps the Leiter-R isn't appropriate for children under two. If that's the case, then option B might not be correct. \n\nNow, considering the other options: adults with visual impairments. Since the test is nonverbal, maybe it's still usable for them. But does it specifically address visual impairments? Or is it just that the nonverbal aspect helps with that? Similarly, children with hearing impairments would benefit from a nonverbal test because they might not understand verbal instructions. But again, the age of the children matters. If the test is for children under two, then maybe that's a different situation. However, the Leiter-R is usually for children up to 16 years old. \n\nWait, the answer choices include \"children under the age of two\" (B). If the Leiter-R isn't designed for that age group, then maybe it's not the best fit. On the other hand, if the test is suitable for very young children, then B could be an answer. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the other options: adults who are mentally retarded. This term is outdated and offensive; the correct term is \"intellectual disabilities.\" However, even if we consider that, the Leiter-R might be used for individuals with intellectual disabilities because it's a nonverbal test, which might be better suited for those who have difficulty with verbal tasks. But I'm not sure if it's specifically for that group. \n\nAnother angle: the Leiter-R is part of the Leiter series of tests, which are known for being culturally fair and nonverbal. They are often used in cases where traditional IQ tests might be biased. For example, children with hearing impairments might struggle with verbal tests, so a nonverbal one like Leiter-R would be better. Similarly, visual impairments could affect their ability to process written instructions, so a nonverbal test would be better. However, the key is whether the test is appropriate for the specific groups mentioned. \n\nBut the question asks which group the Leiter-R would be \"most useful\" for. If the test is suitable for children under two, then B would be the answer. But if it's not, then maybe another option. Wait, the original Leiter-R is for children aged 2-16, so children under two (age 0-1) might not be tested with it. Therefore, B is not correct. \n\nThen, looking at the other options: children with hearing impairments. Since the test is nonverbal, it's a good fit for them because they don't rely on verbal instructions. Similarly, adults with visual impairments could use the test, but maybe the test is more commonly used with children. \n\nHowever, the answer choices include (C) children with hearing impairments. But maybe the Leiter-R is not specifically for hearing-impaired children, but rather for any group that can't take verbal tests. However, the question is about which group the scale is \"most useful\" for. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter-R is sometimes used in clinical settings for individuals with intellectual disabilities, including adults, but the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated. However, option D says \"adults who are mentally retarded,\" which might be referring to those with intellectual disabilities. But again, the test is nonverbal, so it could be used for them. \n\nBut the key point is that the Leiter-R is designed to assess intelligence without relying on verbal skills. Therefore, it's particularly useful for groups that have limitations in verbal communication, such as children with hearing impairments (since they can't hear verbal instructions), visual impairments (if the test requires visual processing, but maybe not—wait, the test is nonverbal, so it's not dependent on visual acuity but on cognitive abilities. Wait, no—the test involves tasks that may require visual processing, so someone with visual impairments might struggle. But the Leiter-R is often adapted for such individuals, using tactile materials or other methods. However, the question is about which group it's \"most useful\" for. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter-R is known to be suitable for children with developmental disabilities, including those with Down syndrome, autism, etc., but the answer options don't mention that. \n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is (C) children with hearing impairments because the test is nonverbal, which allows them to perform without needing to understand spoken language. However, I need to confirm. \n\nWait, but the Leiter-R is also used for children with other conditions. However, the question is about which group the scale is most useful for. If the test is nonverbal, then both hearing and visual impairments could be candidates. However, if the test is designed for younger children, then maybe children with hearing impairments (who might need nonverbal assessments) would be more relevant. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter-R is considered a better option for individuals who cannot take standard verbal tests, such as those with hearing impairments. So the answer might be (C). \n\nBut another thought: the Leiter-R is often used in educational settings for children with intellectual disabilities. However, the answer options include (D) adults who are mentally retarded. But again, the term is outdated. \n\nI think the key here is that the Leiter-R is a nonverbal test, so it's suitable for people who can't take verbal tests, such as children with hearing impairments. Therefore, the answer would be (C). But I need to check if the test is suitable for children under two. If the test is for children aged 2-16, then (B) is incorrect. \n\nSo putting it all together, the most probable answer is (C) children with hearing impairments.",
