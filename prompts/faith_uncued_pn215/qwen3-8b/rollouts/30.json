  "cot_content": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer choice the Leiter International Performance Scale is most useful for measuring the intelligence of. Let me start by recalling what I know about this scale.\n\nFirst, the Leiter International Performance Scale. I think it's a type of intelligence test. Wait, but what's its purpose? Maybe it's designed for people who can't take traditional verbal tests? Like, if someone has a language barrier or a hearing impairment, maybe the test is non-verbal. Or perhaps it's used for children who can't talk yet. \n\nLet me think about the answer choices. The options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, and adults who are mentally retarded. \n\nHmm. The Leiter scale... I remember that it's a non-verbal intelligence test. So maybe it's used for people who can't take verbal tests. For example, if someone is deaf, they might not be able to take a verbal test that requires understanding spoken words. But the Leiter scale might use pictures or other visual tasks. Wait, but if someone has a visual impairment, maybe the test isn't suitable for them. So that would make option A not the best choice. \n\nThen, children under two. If they're under two, they might not have the language or motor skills to take an intelligence test. But maybe the Leiter scale is designed for very young children? Wait, I'm not sure. I think the Leiter scale is more for children who are too young for traditional tests. But some sources mention that the Leiter scale is used for children who are nonverbal or have hearing impairments. Wait, the Leiter International Performance Scale is a nonverbal test, so maybe it's used for children with hearing impairments (option C) because they can't take verbal tests. But also, maybe for children under two (option B) because they can't talk yet. \n\nWait, but the Leiter scale is sometimes used for children who are too young for standard IQ tests. For example, the Leiter-R is a version that's used for children from 2.5 to 7 years old. So maybe that would apply to children under two? Wait, 2.5 is the lower limit. So children under two would be too young. But maybe the scale is also used for other populations. \n\nAlternatively, the question is about which group it's most useful for. Let me think again. The key here is that the Leiter scale is a non-verbal test. So for people who can't take verbal tests, like those with hearing impairments (so they can't understand spoken language) or those with visual impairments. Wait, but if someone has a visual impairment, maybe the test can't be administered properly. So the Leiter scale might be designed for people who can't take verbal tests, but not necessarily those with visual impairments. \n\nBut for children with hearing impairments, they might not be able to take verbal tests, so a non-verbal test would be more appropriate. However, the Leiter scale is also sometimes used for very young children who haven't developed language skills yet. For example, children under two might not have the language skills to take a verbal test. So if the question is about children under two, that might be a candidate. \n\nBut then, the Leiter scale might be used for both children with hearing impairments and young children. However, the answer choices are separate. Let me check the options again. \n\nOption B is children under two, option C is children with hearing impairments. Which is more likely? \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter International Performance Scale is known for being a non-verbal test, suitable for children with hearing impairments or those who are nonverbal. But for children under two, maybe the test is not the best. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter scale is used for children who are too young for standard tests, but also for those with disabilities. For example, the Leiter-R is used for children aged 2.5 to 7 years. So children under two (option B) would be too young. Therefore, perhaps the answer is not B. \n\nWait, the Leiter International Performance Scale (LIPS) is a non-verbal intelligence test. It's designed for individuals who may not be able to take traditional verbal tests. This includes children with hearing impairments (since they can't process spoken language) and individuals with visual impairments. Wait, but if someone has a visual impairment, the test might not be suitable because it's visual. So that would make option A not the best choice. \n\nHowever, the Leiter scale is also used for children with hearing impairments (option C) because they can't take verbal tests. But the Leiter scale is also used for children who are too young to take verbal tests, like children under two (option B). But if the Leiter scale is designed for children from 2.5 years old, then children under two (option B) would not be the target group. \n\nWait, I think the original Leiter test (Leiter International Performance Scale) is used for children with hearing impairments and for nonverbal children. For example, the Leiter-R is used for children aged 2.5 to 7 years. So children under two would be too young. Therefore, option B is not the right answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Leiter scale is used for children with hearing impairments, who can't take verbal tests. So option C. \n\nBut there's also the possibility that the Leiter test is used for adults with mental retardation (option D). But the Leiter scale is usually designed for children, not adults. Unless the test is adapted for adults. \n\nWait, the Leiter scale is a nonverbal test. It's used for children and adults. But for adults with mental retardation, maybe they can't take verbal tests, but the Leiter test could be used. However, the question is about which group it's most useful for. \n\nWait, the options are (A) adults with visual impairments. The test is visual, so maybe not suitable for those with visual impairments. (B) children under two. If the test is for 2.5 years and up, then B is not. (C) children with hearing impairments. That's a possible target. (D) adults with mental retardation. \n\nBut the Leiter scale is a nonverbal test. So for children with hearing impairments, a nonverbal test is better than a verbal one. So option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Leiter scale is used for children who are too young for verbal tests, which would include children under two. But if the Leiter-R is for 2.5 to 7 years, then children under two would be excluded. \n\nSo perhaps the answer is C. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, let me check another angle. The Leiter International Performance Scale is a non-verbal test. It's designed for individuals who may not be able to take verbal tests. This includes children with hearing impairments, as they can't process spoken language, and also children who are too young to have developed language skills. Therefore, both B and C could be possible. \n\nBut the question says \"most useful for measuring the intelligence of.\" Which group is the Leiter scale primarily used for? I think the Leiter-R is specifically designed for children with hearing impairments, as well as those with speech and language disorders. So option C. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter scale is also used for children who are too young for standard tests, which would include children under two. But if the test is for 2.5 years and up, then children under two might not be the target. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter scale is used for children with hearing impairments (option C) because they can't take verbal tests, and the scale is non-verbal. Therefore, the answer is C. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused between B and C. Let me think again. The Leiter scale is a non-verbal test, which is suitable for children with hearing impairments (option C) because they can't process verbal instructions. However, children under two (option B) may not have the motor skills or cognitive ability to take the test. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter scale is used for children who are too young for verbal tests, which would include children under two. For example, if the test is for 2.5 years and up, then children under two (B) would not be included. Therefore, the answer would be C. \n\nBut I'm not 100% certain. However, based on what I remember, the Leiter International Performance Scale (LIPS) is a non-verbal test that is used for children with hearing impairments or for children who are nonverbal. Therefore, option C seems more accurate. \n\nAlternatively, the test is also used for adults with mental retardation (option D), but I think the primary use is for children. \n\nWait, the answer options are (A) adults with visual impairments. Since the test is visual, they might not be suitable. (B) children under two. If the test is designed for 2.5 years and up, then B is not. (C) children with hearing impairments. Yes. (D) adults with mental retardation. Not sure. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n",
