  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is about the Leiter International Performance Scale and which group it's most useful for measuring intelligence. The answer choices are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, or adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Leiter International Performance Scale is. From what I remember, it's a type of intelligence test. But wait, I think it's specifically designed for individuals who might have difficulties with traditional verbal tests. Maybe it's nonverbal? Because some tests use performance-based tasks instead of relying on language.\n\nLet me think. The Leiter scale is a nonverbal intelligence test. That means it doesn't depend on verbal skills, so it's suitable for people who can't take verbal tests, like those with hearing impairments or language barriers. But the answer choices include children under two and adults with visual impairments. Wait, but children under two might not be able to take any standardized test, right? Because they're too young. So maybe that's not the right answer.\n\nThen there's the option of children with hearing impairments. Since the Leiter test is nonverbal, it could be useful for them. But wait, the answer choices also include adults with visual impairments. However, visual impairments might not affect nonverbal tests as much if the test is designed to be accessible. But perhaps the Leiter test is more tailored for those who can't take traditional verbal tests, which would include people with hearing impairments or other language issues.\n\nWait, the options are (A) adults with visual impairments, (B) children under two, (C) children with hearing impairments, (D) adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nNow, the Leiter scale is known for being a nonverbal test, so it's appropriate for those who have hearing impairments because they can't rely on verbal instructions. But what about children under two? That's way too young for most intelligence tests. The Leiter test might be for children, but the age range isn't specified here. However, the answer (B) is children under two, which might not be feasible. The Leiter test is more likely for children who can perform tasks, so maybe (C) is a better choice. \n\nWait, but the question is asking which group the Leiter test is most useful for. If the test is nonverbal, then children with hearing impairments (C) would benefit because they can't take verbal tests. Adults with visual impairments (A) might still be able to take nonverbal tests, but maybe the test is designed for those who can't take verbal tests, which would include both hearing and visual impairments. However, the problem is that some tests might have visual components. But the Leiter test is designed to be nonverbal, so it doesn't rely on language, so maybe it's suitable for both. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be (D) adults who are mentally retarded. But that's not a standard term now; it's more accurate to say individuals with intellectual disabilities. However, the Leiter test is used for people with intellectual disabilities because it's nonverbal. But the question is about which group it's most useful for. Wait, but the Leiter test is also used for children with developmental disabilities, but the options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, and adults with intellectual disabilities. \n\nWait, the Leiter International Performance Scale is actually a nonverbal intelligence test, which is suitable for individuals with language disorders or those who are deaf, as it doesn't require verbal responses. So for children with hearing impairments (C), this would be a good test. But what about adults with visual impairments? If the test is nonverbal and can be adapted, then maybe. However, the answer options might have more specific reasons. \n\nAlternatively, the test is designed for children, but the answer (B) is children under two, which is too young. So (C) is more likely. Also, the Leiter test is used for children with developmental delays, so (C) might be the answer. \n\nWait, but the Leiter test is also used for adults. But the answer (D) is adults who are mentally retarded. However, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated, but assuming the question uses that term, the Leiter test could be used for them. However, the question is about which group it's most useful for. \n\nAlternatively, the test is designed to be nonverbal, so it's suitable for those who can't take verbal tests, such as hearing-impaired children (C). So the answer is (C). \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be (D), but I'm not sure. Wait, the Leiter test is a performance scale, so it's used to assess intelligence without relying on verbal ability. So for children with hearing impairments, who might have difficulty with verbal tests, the Leiter test would be more appropriate. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is (C) children with hearing impairments.\n",
