  "cot_content": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is about the Leiter International Performance Scale and which group it's most useful for measuring intelligence. The options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, or adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Leiter International Performance Scale is. From what I remember, it's a type of intelligence test designed to be non-verbal, right? So maybe it's meant for people who can't take traditional verbal tests. That makes sense because some individuals might have difficulties with language or speech, so a non-verbal test would be more appropriate.\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices. Let's consider each one. \n\nOption A: Adults with visual impairments. If the test is non-verbal, maybe it doesn't require reading or seeing pictures. But wait, if someone has a visual impairment, they might struggle with visual components of the test. However, the Leiter scale might have alternative formats or not rely on visual elements. Not sure yet.\n\nOption B: Children under two. Young children, especially under two, are typically not tested with standardized intelligence tests. Their cognitive development is still very early, and most tests are designed for older children. So maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption C: Children with hearing impairments. Again, if the test is non-verbal, then hearing impairments wouldn't necessarily affect their ability to take it. However, some tests might involve spoken instructions. If the Leiter scale is non-verbal and uses visual symbols or gestures, it could be suitable. But I'm not certain.\n\nOption D: Adults who are mentally retarded. Wait, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated; the correct term now is intellectual disability. But regardless, the Leiter scale is supposed to measure intelligence. However, if someone has an intellectual disability, they might not be able to take standard tests. But since the Leiter is non-verbal, perhaps it's designed for such individuals. However, I think that the Leiter scale is often used for younger children, especially those with developmental delays, not necessarily adults with intellectual disabilities. Also, the term \"mentally retarded\" is offensive and outdated, but I'll focus on the test's purpose.\n\nWait, I think the Leiter International Performance Scale is actually intended for children, especially those with developmental disabilities or language barriers. It's a performance-based test that assesses cognitive abilities without relying on verbal skills. So, if a child has a hearing impairment (Option C), they might benefit from a non-verbal test, as they can't hear verbal instructions. Similarly, children with visual impairments (Option A) might struggle with visual tasks. However, the Leiter scale might have adaptations. But maybe the key point is that the test is suitable for those who can't take verbal tests. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter scale is often used for children with hearing impairments because it doesn't depend on spoken language. For example, children with hearing impairments might not understand verbal instructions, so a non-verbal test would be better. Therefore, Option C might be the answer. But I need to check if there's any specific information about the Leiter scale's target population. \n\nWait, another thought: the Leiter scale is designed for children, particularly those who have difficulty with verbal tests. So children under two (Option B) aren't the target. Adults with visual impairments (Option A) might not be the focus. The test is for children with disabilities, including hearing impairments (Option C). But also, adults with intellectual disabilities (Option D) could be assessed, but the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated. However, the Leiter scale might not be suitable for adults with significant intellectual disabilities because it's more for younger populations. \n\nI think the correct answer is Option C: children with hearing impairments. Because the Leiter scale is non-verbal and non-linguistic, making it suitable for those who cannot use language effectively, like children with hearing impairments. Alternatively, maybe it's for children with visual impairments, but I'm not sure. Wait, but the test itself might have visual components. If the child has a visual impairment, they might not be able to see the stimuli. So maybe the Leiter scale is designed to be non-verbal and not reliant on vision, but that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter scale is known for being a non-verbal intelligence test, suitable for children with speech or language disorders, including hearing impairments. Therefore, Option C is the best fit. So the answer should be C.",
