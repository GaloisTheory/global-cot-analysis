  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is about which group the Leiter International Performance Scale would be most useful for measuring intelligence. The options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, or adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Leiter International Performance Scale is. From what I remember, it's a type of intelligence test. I think it's an assessment that's designed to be non-verbal, which means it doesn't rely on language. That might be important because some groups might have difficulties with verbal tests. For example, people with hearing impairments might struggle with verbal components, but if the test is non-verbal, that could be an advantage.\n\nWait, the Leiter scale is a performance scale, so it's likely based on non-verbal tasks. That would make it suitable for individuals who might have trouble with verbal tests, like those with hearing impairments or language barriers. But let me think about each option.\n\nOption A: Adults with visual impairments. If the test requires visual tasks, then adults with visual impairments might not be able to take it. But if the test is non-verbal and can be adapted, maybe it's okay. However, I'm not sure if the Leiter test is designed for visual impairments specifically. Maybe other tests are better for that.\n\nOption B: Children under two. That's very young. Most intelligence tests for toddlers are not standard because their cognitive development isn't fully assessed yet. The Leiter might not be appropriate here. I don't think the Leiter is used for such young children.\n\nOption C: Children with hearing impairments. Since the Leiter is non-verbal, it might not rely on spoken words. So children with hearing impairments could take it without needing to understand verbal instructions. That makes sense. But I need to check if that's the primary use.\n\nOption D: Adults who are mentally retarded. Wait, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated and not preferred. The term now is \"intellectual disability.\" But assuming the question uses the old term, the Leiter test might be used for this group. However, some tests are designed for individuals with intellectual disabilities, but maybe the Leiter is more for those with non-verbal abilities, like children with hearing impairments.\n\nWait, the Leiter International Performance Scale is known for being a non-verbal intelligence test that's used for individuals with various disabilities, including those who have difficulty with verbal tests. So if the question is about which group it's most useful for, then children with hearing impairments (option C) might be a candidate because they can take a non-verbal test. However, adults with visual impairments (A) might not be able to take a test that requires visual tasks. But if the test is adapted, maybe it's possible. But I think the Leiter is more focused on non-verbal abilities, so for those with hearing impairments, it's a better fit. Also, children under two (B) might not be suitable. Adults with intellectual disabilities (D) could be tested with it, but the term is outdated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Leiter International Performance Scale is designed for young children, but the options include children under two. However, the Leiter test is typically for children up to a certain age, but not under two. \n\nAnother point: the Leiter test is often used in clinical settings for individuals with developmental disabilities, including those with hearing impairments. So the answer might be C. But I need to be careful. Let me think again. The key is that the test is performance-based and non-verbal, so it's useful for those who can't take traditional verbal tests. So for hearing impairments, the test doesn't require verbal skills, so that's a good fit. For adults with visual impairments, maybe the test has visual components, but if it's adapted, maybe not. But the question is about which group would the test be most useful for. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the test is not suitable for children under two. Therefore, the answer is C. Or D? But the term \"mentally retarded\" is not a correct term. However, the options might use that term. If the question is about adults with intellectual disabilities, then the Leiter test could be used. However, I think the Leiter is more for children, perhaps. \n\nWait, I think the Leiter International Performance Scale is a standardized test that's used for children, especially those with developmental disabilities, and it's a non-verbal test. So children with hearing impairments (option C) would be a good fit because they can perform non-verbal tasks. Therefore, the answer would be C. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is D, but the term is outdated. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter test is used for individuals who have trouble with verbal tests, like those with hearing impairments, so the answer is C. \n\nI think the answer is C. Therefore, the best answer is: (C).\n",
