  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is about the Leiter International Performance Scale and which group it's most useful for measuring intelligence. The answer choices are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, or adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Leiter International Performance Scale is. From what I remember, it's a type of intelligence test designed to be non-verbal, which means it doesn't rely on language. That makes sense because some groups might have difficulties with verbal tests, like those with hearing impairments or visual impairments. But wait, the question is about which group it would be most useful for. \n\nLet me think about the options. If the test is non-verbal, then maybe it's good for people with hearing impairments because they can't rely on spoken words. But also, visual impairments might be a problem if the test requires visual elements. Wait, but maybe the Leiter test is designed to be accessible to people with various sensory impairments. However, children under two might not be able to take a standardized test. They're too young, so that's probably not the answer. \n\nLooking at the options again: (B) children under two. That seems unlikely because most intelligence tests require a certain level of development. So maybe B is not correct. \n\nNow, adults with visual impairments. If the test is non-verbal, maybe it's designed to be administered in a way that's accessible to visually impaired individuals, like using touch or other sensory methods. But I'm not sure if that's the primary purpose. \n\nChildren with hearing impairments. Since the Leiter test is non-verbal, perhaps it's more suitable for them because they might struggle with verbal tests. However, the test might also have components that require visual or motor skills, which could be a problem for some. \n\nWait, but the question is about which group the test would be most useful for. The Leiter International Performance Scale is known for being a non-verbal test that is suitable for individuals with various disabilities, including those with hearing or visual impairments. But which one is more specific? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) adults who are mentally retarded. But I'm not sure. Wait, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated, but assuming that's the intended term here, the Leiter test is designed to assess intelligence without relying on verbal skills, so it could be used for people with intellectual disabilities. However, the question is about which group it's most useful for. \n\nBut wait, the answer choices are (A) adults with visual impairments, (B) children under two, (C) children with hearing impairments, (D) adults who are mentally retarded. \n\nI think the key here is that the Leiter test is non-verbal, so it's more suitable for those who have difficulty with verbal tests. So for children with hearing impairments (C), since they can't rely on spoken instructions, a non-verbal test would be better. But also, adults with visual impairments might need a test that doesn't require reading. However, the Leiter test might be designed in a way that is accessible to both. \n\nBut the question is about which group it's most useful for. Maybe the answer is (C) children with hearing impairments because the test is non-verbal and doesn't rely on language, which is a big issue for hearing-impaired children. Alternatively, the Leiter test might not be the best for children under two (B) because they are too young. \n\nWait, another angle: the Leiter test is a performance scale, which means it's based on tasks that can be performed, not necessarily on verbal responses. So for children under two, they might not be able to perform the tasks required. So (B) is not correct. \n\nFor adults with visual impairments, if the test is non-verbal, maybe it's not the best because some tasks might still require visual elements. But if the test is adapted for them, then maybe. But the question is about which group it's most useful for. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter test is known for being suitable for people with intellectual disabilities, so (D) might be the answer. But I'm not sure. Wait, the Leiter International Performance Scale is a type of IQ test that is designed to be non-verbal, which is useful for people with hearing impairments, visual impairments, or those with limited language skills. But which group is the best fit? \n\nI think that children with hearing impairments (C) would benefit the most from a non-verbal test because they can't rely on spoken instructions. However, maybe the answer is (D) adults who are mentally retarded. But the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated, but assuming that's the case, the Leiter test is designed for people with intellectual disabilities. \n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me check my memory. The Leiter test is non-verbal and is considered to be suitable for individuals with various disabilities, including those with visual or hearing impairments. However, for children under two, it's too young. For children with hearing impairments, a non-verbal test would be more appropriate. But the answer might be (C). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (A) because the test is non-verbal and can be adapted for visual impairments. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the Leiter International Performance Scale is known for being a non-verbal intelligence test that is suitable for assessing individuals with various disabilities. It's often used with children and adults who have hearing impairments or intellectual disabilities. However, the question is which group it is most useful for. \n\nIf the answer choices are between (C) and (D), then which is more likely? The Leiter test is designed to be used with children and adults with intellectual disabilities. So (D) might be the answer. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if the answer is (C) because the test is non-verbal, which is better for hearing-impaired children. But I need to recall more accurately. \n\nWait, I think the Leiter test is considered to be suitable for children with hearing impairments because it doesn't require verbal responses. Therefore, (C) would be the answer. \n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Another thought: the Leiter test is a performance scale, which is non-verbal, and it's used for children and adults. So maybe (D) is the answer because it's for individuals with intellectual disabilities, but the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be (A) adults with visual impairments if the test is designed to be accessible to them. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me think again. The Leiter International Performance Scale is designed to be a non-verbal test, which is useful for individuals who cannot take verbal tests. So for children with hearing impairments (C), they can't take verbal tests, so non-verbal tests are better. Similarly, adults with visual impairments (A) might have difficulty with tests that require reading. But which group is the primary target? \n\nThe Leiter test is often used with children with hearing impairments, as it's a non-verbal test suitable for those who can't rely on verbal instructions. So I think (C) is the answer. \n\nBut I'm not 100% certain. Another angle: the Leiter test is also used with individuals with intellectual disabilities. But the question is about which group the test would be most useful for. If the options are between (C) and (D), then maybe (C) is more about sensory impairments, while (D) is about intellectual disabilities. \n\nThe Leiter test is designed to be non-verbal, which makes it suitable for both. However, the test's primary use might be for children with sensory impairments. Alternatively, for children with hearing impairments, since they can't use verbal instructions, the non-verbal test is more appropriate. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) children with hearing impairments.\n",
