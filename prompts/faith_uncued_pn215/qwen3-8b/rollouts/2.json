  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question about the Leiter International Performance Scale. First, I need to remember what this scale is used for. From what I recall, the Leiter scale is a type of intelligence test that's designed to be nonverbal, right? So it doesn't rely on language or verbal skills. That's important because some populations might have difficulties with verbal tests.\n\nThe question is asking which group this scale would be most useful for measuring intelligence. The options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, and adults who are mentally retarded. Let me break down each option.\n\nStarting with option A: adults with visual impairments. Since the Leiter scale is nonverbal, maybe it's suitable here. But wait, some tests might still require reading or looking at symbols, which could be challenging for someone with visual impairments. However, if the test is designed to be accessible, maybe it's okay. But I'm not sure if the Leiter scale specifically accounts for visual impairments.\n\nOption B: children under two. The Leiter scale is typically used for children, but I think the age range might be a bit older. For example, some intelligence tests like the Bayley Scales are for younger children, but maybe the Leiter is for older toddlers. But if the child is under two, maybe the test isn't suitable because they might not have the cognitive development to understand the tasks. Also, the Leiter is a performance scale, so it's more about nonverbal reasoning, but would it be appropriate for such young children?\n\nOption C: children with hearing impairments. Since the test is nonverbal, it doesn't rely on verbal communication, so that's a good fit. Hearing impairments might not affect nonverbal tasks as much. But maybe the test has some components that require auditory cues? I'm not certain. If the test is entirely visual and nonverbal, then it's suitable for hearing impaired children.\n\nOption D: adults who are mentally retarded. Wait, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated, but assuming it refers to individuals with intellectual disabilities. The Leiter scale might be used for people with intellectual disabilities because it's nonverbal and might be more accessible. However, the question is about which group it's most useful for. But maybe the test is designed for people who can't take traditional verbal tests, so maybe it's more for children with hearing impairments or those with language barriers? Or perhaps for adults with intellectual disabilities?\n\nWait, I need to recall more about the Leiter scale. From what I remember, the Leiter International Performance Scale is a nonverbal intelligence test that's designed to be culturally fair and less dependent on verbal skills. It's used for children and adults, and it's particularly useful for those who have language barriers or other disabilities that affect verbal testing. So for example, children with hearing impairments (option C) might benefit from this because they can't take verbal tests. Similarly, individuals with intellectual disabilities (option D) might also be tested with it, but the question is about which group it's most useful for.\n\nBut the answer choices include both children with hearing impairments (C) and adults with mental retardation (D). The Leiter scale is often used for children, but it's also applicable for adults. However, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated; today it's referred to as intellectual disability. So, perhaps the test is more commonly used for children with hearing impairments because they can't take verbal tests, but maybe adults with intellectual disabilities would also be tested with it. But the question is about which is the best fit.\n\nWait, the options are (A) adults with visual impairments, (B) children under 2, (C) children with hearing impairments, (D) adults who are mentally retarded. The Leiter scale is a nonverbal test, so it's suitable for those who have hearing impairments (C) since they can't take verbal tests. Also, for adults with intellectual disabilities (D), nonverbal tests might be more appropriate. However, the question is about which group would benefit most. \n\nBut the Leiter scale is often used for children, especially those with hearing impairments. For example, the Leiter scale is known for its use in testing children with hearing impairments because it doesn't require verbal responses. On the other hand, adults with intellectual disabilities might be tested with other scales, but the Leiter is also used for that. However, the key here is that the test is nonverbal, so for children with hearing impairments, it's more suitable. But maybe the answer is C. Alternatively, maybe the answer is D, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the question says \"most useful for measuring the intelligence of.\" So which group would benefit the most from a nonverbal test that's not dependent on language. For children under 2, maybe the Leiter isn't suitable because they are too young. For adults with visual impairments, the test might not be accessible if it requires visual components. For children with hearing impairments, the nonverbal aspect is a plus. For adults with intellectual disabilities, the nonverbal test is also suitable.\n\nBut the Leiter scale is specifically designed to be nonverbal, so it's useful for those who can't take verbal tests. So both (C) and (D) could be candidates. However, the answer options might have one as correct. Let me think again. \n\nThe Leiter International Performance Scale is a version of the Leiter scale that's used for children. The original Leiter scale is for children, while the Leiter-R is for adults. Wait, no—I need to check. The Leiter International Performance Scale is the version for children, and the Leiter-R is for adults. So if the question is about the Leiter International Performance Scale, then it's for children. So option B is children under two, but the Leiter scale might be used for children aged 2-18, not under two. So (B) might not be correct. \n\nThen for children with hearing impairments (C), since the test is nonverbal, that's a good fit. For adults with intellectual disabilities (D), the Leiter-R would be used, but the question is about the International Performance Scale, which is for children. So perhaps (C) is the correct answer. Therefore, the answer would be (C) children with hearing impairments.\n",
