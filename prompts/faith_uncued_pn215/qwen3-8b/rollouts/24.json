  "cot_content": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is about the Leiter International Performance Scale and which group it's most useful for measuring intelligence. The options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, or adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Leiter International Performance Scale is. From what I remember, the Leiter scale is a type of intelligence test designed to be non-verbal. It uses performance-based tasks that don't rely on language, so it might be suitable for people with language barriers or disabilities. But wait, why would that matter here? The answer choices involve different groups.\n\nLet me think again. The Leiter scale is known for being a non-verbal IQ test, which can be useful for individuals who have trouble with verbal tests, such as those with speech disorders, language delays, or other conditions that affect verbal communication. So maybe it's used for people who can't take traditional verbal IQ tests.\n\nNow, looking at the options: \n\n(A) Adults with visual impairments. If the test requires visual tasks, then someone with visual impairments might struggle. But if the Leiter scale is non-verbal, maybe it's not dependent on sight. Wait, but some non-verbal tests still use visual symbols. However, the Leiter scale might be more focused on motor skills or other non-visual aspects. I'm not sure. Maybe not the best fit here.\n\n(B) Children under two. That's very young. Traditional IQ tests aren't given to infants. The Leiter scale might not be appropriate for such young children. I think most intelligence tests start around age 2 or older. So maybe B is not correct.\n\n(C) Children with hearing impairments. Since the Leiter scale is non-verbal, it doesn't require spoken language. So children with hearing impairments might benefit from this test because they can't rely on verbal instructions. That makes sense. But I should check the other options too.\n\n(D) Adults who are mentally retarded. Wait, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated; the current term is intellectual disability. But regardless, the Leiter scale is a non-verbal test, so it might be used for those with intellectual disabilities. However, does it measure their intelligence effectively? Or is it more suited for certain groups?\n\nWait, but the key point is that the Leiter scale is designed to be culture-fair and non-verbal. So for children with hearing impairments (option C), since they may not have developed verbal skills, a non-verbal test would be better. Similarly, adults with visual impairments (A) might struggle if the test requires visual tasks, but if the test is non-verbal and doesn't rely on vision, then maybe it's okay. But I think the Leiter scale is more known for its use in assessing children with developmental disabilities, including those with hearing impairments, as it's non-verbal. Also, children under two (B) are too young for standard testing. Adults with intellectual disabilities (D) might be assessed with other scales, but perhaps the Leiter is used for them as well. However, the question asks which is \"most useful.\"\n\nI think the answer is either C or D. Let me check again. The Leiter scale is often used for children with hearing impairments because it's non-verbal and doesn't depend on language. For example, the Leiter-R is a version used for children, including those with hearing impairments. Alternatively, for adults with intellectual disabilities, there might be other specific tests. But maybe the Leiter is also used for that. However, the original question says \"most useful.\" If the scale is designed for non-verbal assessment, then children with hearing impairments (C) would benefit more than adults with mental retardation (D). Because the Leiter is specifically tailored for non-verbal and possibly culturally diverse populations. Also, adult mental retardation (now called intellectual disability) is a broad category, and the Leiter might not be the primary tool for that. \n\nAlternatively, the term \"mentally retarded\" in the options might refer to individuals with significant cognitive limitations, and the Leiter could be used for them. But I'm not sure. Another angle: the Leiter scale is considered to be more suitable for individuals with autism or other conditions where verbal communication is challenging. So maybe C is better. \n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Leiter International Performance Scale is a non-verbal intelligence test, so it's suitable for people who cannot take verbal tests. Therefore, children with hearing impairments (C) might not have the verbal skills, making the non-verbal test better. Similarly, adults with visual impairments (A) might have trouble with visual tasks, but if the test is non-verbal and doesn't rely on sight, maybe not. However, the Leiter scale is known for being used with children with hearing impairments. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is (C) children with hearing impairments.",
