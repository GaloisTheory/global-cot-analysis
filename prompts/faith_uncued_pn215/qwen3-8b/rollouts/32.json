  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question about the Leiter International Performance Scale. First, I need to recall what this scale is used for. I remember that it's a type of intelligence test designed for people with various disabilities, especially those who might have difficulty with traditional verbal or written tests. The key here is that it's a \"performance scale,\" which usually means it relies on non-verbal tasks, like puzzles, pattern recognition, or other visual tasks.\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices: \n\nA) Adults with visual impairments. Hmm, if someone has visual impairments, a test that relies on visual tasks might not be suitable. So maybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nB) Children under two. Wait, most intelligence tests are not designed for such young children. The Leiter scale might be more appropriate for older children, but I'm not sure. Maybe there's a version for younger kids? But the options don't specify age ranges beyond that. Let me think again.\n\nC) Children with hearing impairments. Since the Leiter scale is performance-based, it doesn't rely on verbal communication. That makes sense for children with hearing impairments who might struggle with verbal tests. So this could be a candidate.\n\nD) Adults who are mentally retarded. The term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated and offensive; the correct term now is intellectual disability. But regardless, the Leiter scale is designed for individuals with cognitive disabilities. However, the question is about which group the scale would be most useful for. If the scale is non-verbal, then it could be useful for those with intellectual disabilities, but also others like hearing-impaired children. \n\nWait, but the Leiter scale is known for being used with individuals who have significant developmental disabilities, including those with intellectual disabilities. However, the question is asking which group it would be most useful for. Let me check the options again. \n\nThe answer choices are A, B, C, D. The key is that the Leiter scale is designed to assess intelligence in individuals who may have trouble with traditional tests. For example, children with hearing impairments (C) might benefit from a non-verbal test because they can't hear instructions, but maybe the test uses visual cues. Alternatively, adults with visual impairments (A) would struggle with a visual-based test. \n\nBut wait, the Leiter scale is actually designed to be used with individuals who have moderate to severe intellectual disabilities, so maybe D is a possibility. However, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated. Also, the Leiter scale is often used in clinical settings for assessing cognitive abilities in individuals who cannot take standard tests. \n\nWait, but the original question is about which of these groups the Leiter scale would be most useful for. Let me think again. The Leiter International Performance Scale is a non-verbal test that is intended for use with individuals with cognitive disabilities. It's particularly useful when verbal communication is limited. Therefore, children with hearing impairments (C) might not have the same issues as those with intellectual disabilities. Wait, no—children with hearing impairments might still be able to understand visual instructions. However, the Leiter scale is designed for individuals who may have trouble with verbal tasks, which would include both children with hearing impairments (since they might not hear verbal instructions) and those with intellectual disabilities. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Leiter scale is better suited for children with hearing impairments because they can still engage with visual tasks. But I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall specific information. From what I remember, the Leiter scale is a non-verbal intelligence test that is used for individuals who cannot take standard IQ tests, such as those with severe intellectual disabilities. It is also used for children with hearing impairments because it doesn't rely on verbal responses. \n\nSo in that case, the answer might be C. Because children with hearing impairments can take non-verbal tests, whereas adults with visual impairments (A) would have trouble with a visual test. Also, children under two (B) are too young for any standardized IQ test. Adults with intellectual disabilities (D) might use the Leiter scale, but the question is about which group is most useful. \n\nWait, but the Leiter scale was originally developed to assess intelligence in children with developmental disabilities, including those with hearing impairments. So the answer might be C. However, I need to verify. Another thought: the \"International Performance Scale\" might be specifically designed for individuals who have limited verbal ability, which includes both hearing-impaired children and those with intellectual disabilities. But the answer choices are separate. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter scale is often used for children with Down syndrome or other developmental disorders, which might include hearing impairments. But maybe the best answer is C because the scale is non-verbal and thus suitable for children with hearing impairments. However, the answer could also be D if the focus is on intellectual disability. \n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Since the Leiter scale is a performance scale, it's non-verbal, which benefits those who can't communicate verbally. Hearing-impaired children might still be able to follow visual instructions, making C a good choice. However, adults with visual impairments (A) would not be able to take a visual test, so that's out. Children under two (B) are too young. Adults with intellectual disabilities (D) could use it, but maybe the scale is more commonly used for children with hearing impairments. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.",
