  "cot_content": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is about the Leiter International Performance Scale and which group it's most useful for measuring intelligence. The options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, or adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Leiter International Performance Scale is. From what I remember, the Leiter scale is a type of intelligence test that's designed to be non-verbal. It's often used for individuals who might have language barriers or other conditions that affect verbal communication. So, it focuses on performance-based tasks rather than relying on words or language skills.\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices. Let's go through each one. \n\nOption A: Adults with visual impairments. If the test is non-verbal, maybe it's not dependent on seeing things. But some tests might still require visual elements. However, if the Leiter scale is specifically designed to be accessible to people with visual impairments, then maybe it's suitable here. But I'm not sure. I need to check more.\n\nOption B: Children under two. Young children, especially those under two, might not have the cognitive development to take standard intelligence tests. Also, non-verbal tests might be possible, but many tests like the Bayley Scales are used for infants. But does the Leiter scale work for such young children? Maybe not. The Leiter scale is probably for older children and adults.\n\nOption C: Children with hearing impairments. Since the test is non-verbal, it wouldn't rely on spoken language, making it suitable for hearing impaired children. This seems plausible because they can't use verbal responses, so performance-based tasks would be better. But I need to confirm if the Leiter scale is specifically designed for that.\n\nOption D: Adults who are mentally retarded. Wait, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated and offensive; the current term is intellectual disability. But regardless, the Leiter scale is intended for people with intellectual disabilities? Or is it for people who can't take traditional tests? Since it's non-verbal, maybe it's for those with language issues, including those with intellectual disabilities. However, I need to consider if the test is suitable for that group. Also, if the person has an intellectual disability, they might have trouble with certain tasks, but the test's design might accommodate that.\n\nWait, the key here is that the Leiter scale is a nonverbal intelligence test. Nonverbal tests are useful for people who have language barriers, such as those with hearing impairments or speech disorders, or those who are non-native speakers. It's also used when the individual cannot participate in verbal tests, like due to language differences or developmental delays.\n\nSo for children with hearing impairments (option C), since they may not have the ability to understand or respond to verbal instructions, a non-verbal test like Leiter would be more appropriate. Similarly, adults with visual impairments (option A) might need a test that doesn't require reading or visual symbols. However, if the test uses visual elements, then that could be a problem. But if the Leiter scale is designed to be accessible to visually impaired individuals, then option A could be possible. However, I think the primary focus of the Leiter scale is for children with language impairments, like those who can't speak or have hearing loss. \n\nBut wait, the Leiter scale is actually known as the Leiter-R or Leiter International Performance Scale. From what I've studied before, the Leiter scales are nonverbal and are often used for children and adults who have language disabilities. They are considered to be good for assessing intellectual functioning without relying on verbal skills. So for example, children who are deaf or have hearing impairments can take these tests because they don't require spoken language. Therefore, option C would be correct. \n\nBut let me check the other options again. Option D: adults with intellectual disabilities. The Leiter scale can be used for people with intellectual disabilities, but the question is about which group is \"most\" useful. The answer choices are specific. For children with hearing impairments (C), the test is particularly useful because they can't use verbal responses, so a nonverbal test is essential. Whereas for adults with intellectual disabilities, there are other tests like the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), but maybe the Leiter is also used. However, the question is about which group is best suited. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Leiter scale is more commonly used for children, especially those with language issues. Since children under two (B) are too young, and the Leiter scale is likely for older children. So B is probably incorrect. \n\nSo between A, C, and D. \n\nIf the test is nonverbal, then for someone with visual impairment, it's possible they can take it if the test is designed for them. But if the test includes visual components, maybe not. However, the Leiter scale is designed to be nonverbal, but it's possible that it's not tailored for visual impairments. \n\nOn the other hand, for hearing-impaired children, the nonverbal aspect is crucial. So the Leiter scale would be most useful for them. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.",
