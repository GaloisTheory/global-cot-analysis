  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is about the Leiter International Performance Scale and which group it's most useful for measuring intelligence. The options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, or adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Leiter International Performance Scale is. From what I remember, the Leiter scale is a type of intelligence test designed to assess cognitive abilities. It's known for being a nonverbal test, which means it doesn't rely on language or verbal skills. That makes it useful for people who might have difficulties with verbal communication, such as those with hearing impairments or language barriers.\n\nNow, the options. Let's go through them one by one. \n\nOption A: Adults with visual impairments. If the test is nonverbal, maybe it's not affected by visual impairments? Wait, but some tests might require visual elements. However, the Leiter scale is designed to be nonverbal, so maybe it's suitable for those with visual impairments. But I'm not sure if that's the primary use case.\n\nOption B: Children under two. The Leiter scale is probably not suitable for such young children. Most intelligence tests for very young children are different, like the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. The Leiter might be for older children, so maybe not B.\n\nOption C: Children with hearing impairments. Since the Leiter is nonverbal, it doesn't rely on hearing, which would be a big advantage for children with hearing impairments. They might not be able to understand verbal instructions, but nonverbal tests could be more accessible. That seems plausible.\n\nOption D: Adults who are mentally retarded. Wait, \"mentally retarded\" is an outdated term, but assuming it refers to individuals with intellectual disabilities. The Leiter scale might be used for them, but the question is about which group it's \"most useful\" for. Also, some tests are designed for specific populations, but I need to think about the original purpose of the Leiter scale. \n\nWait, the Leiter scale was developed to be a nonverbal test, which is good for people with language barriers or other disabilities. It's often used for children who can't take traditional verbal tests, like those with hearing impairments. But also, adults with visual impairments might need nonverbal tests. However, the test might have visual components. Wait, but the Leiter scale is designed to be nonverbal, so maybe it's more suitable for those who can't use verbal or visual means. Wait, but the question is about which group is most useful. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter scale is known for being used in cases where the individual has a language disorder or is deaf, hence the nonverbal aspect. So for children with hearing impairments, the nonverbal test would be more appropriate. But the answer choices include adults with visual impairments. If the test is nonverbal, maybe it's not affected by visual impairments? Or maybe the test uses other modalities. \n\nWait, I think the Leiter scale is a performance scale, which might involve motor skills or other non-verbal tasks. For example, it might have tasks that don't require reading or listening, so it could be suitable for people with visual or hearing impairments. But the question is which group is it most useful for. \n\nLooking up in my memory, the Leiter scale is often used for children with hearing impairments because they can't take verbal tests. So option C. But then, what about adults with visual impairments? If the test doesn't require reading, maybe it's also suitable. However, maybe the test is designed more for children. Also, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated, but if the question is from an older source, maybe it's referring to adults with intellectual disabilities. However, the Leiter scale is more commonly used for children. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter scale is a nonverbal test, so it's suitable for individuals who cannot take verbal tests, which includes children with hearing impairments (since they can't hear verbal instructions) and possibly adults with visual impairments (if the test is not visual). But the answer might be option C. \n\nAnother angle: the Leiter International Performance Scale is a nonverbal intelligence test that assesses cognitive abilities through performance tasks. It's designed to be suitable for individuals with disabilities that affect verbal communication, such as hearing impairments. Therefore, children with hearing impairments (option C) would benefit from this test. \n\nBut what about adults with visual impairments? If the test requires visual tasks, then they might not be suitable. However, if the test is nonverbal and doesn't rely on visual elements, then it could be used. However, the primary focus of the Leiter scale is likely for children with hearing impairments. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.\n",
