  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out which answer is correct. The question is about the Leiter International Performance Scale and which group it's most useful for measuring intelligence. The options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, or adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Leiter International Performance Scale is. From what I remember, it's a type of intelligence test. I think it's designed to assess cognitive abilities, but maybe it's more suitable for certain populations. Wait, I think it's a nonverbal test, right? Because some tests are designed for people who can't speak or have language barriers. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nLet me think. The Leiter scale is often mentioned in the context of assessing intelligence in individuals who might have language difficulties. For example, people with hearing impairments or those who are nonverbal. Since it's a performance scale, it probably relies on tasks that don't require verbal communication. So that would make it useful for people who can't use language effectively, like those with hearing impairments or maybe those with autism. \n\nNow looking at the answer choices. Option C is children with hearing impairments. If the test is nonverbal, then children with hearing impairments might benefit from it since they might not have the same verbal skills. But wait, the question is about which group it's most useful for. \n\nOption D is adults who are mentally retarded. But the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated; the current term is intellectual disability. However, the test's purpose is to measure intelligence. But if the test is designed for nonverbal individuals, maybe it's more suitable for those with hearing impairments rather than adults with intellectual disabilities. Wait, but intellectual disability could affect multiple areas, including language and verbal skills. \n\nWait, another thought: the Leiter scale is also known for being a culture-fair test, meaning it's less influenced by cultural background. So maybe it's used for people who might not have the same cultural exposure. But that's not directly related to the answer choices here. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter scale might be used for children who are too young for standard tests. For example, children under two (option B) might not be able to take traditional tests. But I think the Leiter scale is used for children, but maybe not under two. Wait, the Leiter scale is sometimes called the Leiter-R or Leiter-3, which are for children and adults. However, if the question is about children under two, maybe that's not the case. \n\nWait, the Leiter International Performance Scale is a nonverbal intelligence test that's designed to be used with individuals who have language impairments or who are too young to take verbal tests. For example, children with hearing impairments (option C) might have difficulty with verbal tests, so a nonverbal test like the Leiter would be more appropriate. \n\nBut then, what about adults with visual impairments (option A)? If the test is visual, then that might be a problem. But if the test is nonverbal and uses other modalities, maybe not. Wait, the Leiter scale uses tasks that don't require reading or writing, so maybe it's accessible to people with visual impairments if they can understand the tasks. But I'm not sure if the test is designed for that. \n\nAlternatively, children under two (option B) might not be able to take any intelligence test, but the Leiter scale is for children, so maybe not. \n\nWait, the key here is that the Leiter scale is appropriate for individuals with language impairments or those who are nonverbal. So children with hearing impairments (option C) would be a good fit because they might not have the same verbal skills as others. \n\nBut then, adults with intellectual disabilities (option D) might also be candidates. However, the Leiter scale is often used for children, and maybe for adults with certain conditions. However, the question is about which group it's most useful for. \n\nAlternatively, the Leiter scale is known for being used with children who have developmental delays, so perhaps children with hearing impairments (option C) would be more appropriate. \n\nWait, another angle: the original Leiter scale was developed to assess cognitive abilities in children with hearing impairments. So if that's the case, then option C would be correct. \n\nBut I need to be careful. Let me think again. The Leiter International Performance Scale is a nonverbal test, which makes it suitable for individuals who have language difficulties. So children with hearing impairments (option C) would be a group that might benefit from such a test. \n\nAlternatively, if the test is nonverbal, then it's not dependent on visual ability, so adults with visual impairments (option A) could take it, but that's not the main focus. \n\nWait, the question asks which group it would be \"most useful for.\" So if the test is designed for children with language issues, then option C is the answer. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused between C and D. However, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated, and the Leiter scale might be used for individuals with intellectual disabilities, but the key is that the test is nonverbal, so maybe it's not specifically for adults with intellectual disabilities but for children with hearing impairments. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (C) children with hearing impairments.\n",
