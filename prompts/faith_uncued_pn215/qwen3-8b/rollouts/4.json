  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is about the Leiter International Performance Scale and which group it's most useful for measuring intelligence. The options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, or adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Leiter International Performance Scale is. From what I remember, it's a type of intelligence test designed to be culturally fair, meaning it doesn't rely on verbal skills as much. It's often used for people who might have language barriers or other issues that make traditional tests less effective. The Leiter scale is known for being nonverbal, using performance-based tasks. \n\nSo, if the test is nonverbal, maybe it's better suited for groups that have difficulties with verbal communication. Let's look at the options. \n\nOption A: Adults with visual impairments. But if the test is visual, then that might not be good. Wait, but maybe the Leiter scale isn't heavily reliant on visual tasks? Or maybe it's designed to be accessible to those with visual impairments? Not sure. \n\nOption B: Children under two. Young children, especially under two, might not be able to perform the tasks required by most intelligence tests. The Leiter test might be for younger children, but I think the Leiter scale is for children starting at age 2 or older. So maybe not B. \n\nOption C: Children with hearing impairments. Since the test is nonverbal, it might be better for those who can't hear or have language issues. If the test doesn't require verbal responses, then hearing impairments wouldn't be a barrier. So this could be a candidate. \n\nOption D: Adults who are mentally retarded. Wait, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated, but assuming that's the intended term, the test might be used for individuals with intellectual disabilities. However, the Leiter scale is designed to be a measure of intelligence, so it's possible. But would it be more suitable for a specific group?\n\nWait, the key point here is that the Leiter scale is a nonverbal, performance-based test. So it's designed for people who might have language barriers or other issues that make verbal tests less effective. So, if someone has a hearing impairment, they might not have the same verbal skills, but the test doesn't require verbal responses. Similarly, adults with visual impairments might struggle with visual tasks, but maybe the test is designed to be accessible. However, children under two might not be able to take the test at all. \n\nBut the question is asking which group would benefit most from the Leiter scale. Let me think again. The Leiter International Performance Scale is a nonverbal intelligence test that is designed to assess cognitive abilities without relying on language. It's often used with children who have language delays or hearing impairments because they can't take verbal tests. So for children with hearing impairments (option C), this test would be more appropriate. \n\nAlternatively, adults with visual impairments (option A) might have issues if the test requires visual tasks, but maybe the Leiter scale has adaptations. But I think the main point is that the Leiter test is nonverbal and suitable for those who can't take verbal tests. So children with hearing impairments (C) would be a better fit. \n\nWait, the term \"mentally retarded\" in option D might be a red herring. The Leiter scale is used for individuals with intellectual disabilities, but the question is about which group is \"most useful\" for measuring intelligence. If the test is for nonverbal, then maybe it's better for children with hearing impairments (C) because they can't take verbal tests. Alternatively, adults with visual impairments (A) could also be a group that might not be able to take verbal tests. But the Leiter test is designed for children, perhaps. \n\nWait, the Leiter scale is a series of tests, like the Leiter-R for children. The Leiter-R is a nonverbal intelligence test for children aged 2.5 to 16 years. So if the test is for children, then option B (children under 2) might not be correct because the test starts at 2.5. So option B is not correct. \n\nSo between C and D. The Leiter-R is used for children with language delays, hearing impairments, etc. So children with hearing impairments (C) would be a group that would benefit from the nonverbal test. \n\nBut what about option D: adults who are mentally retarded. The Leiter test is designed for a range of individuals, including those with intellectual disabilities. However, the question is about which group is \"most\" useful. The test is designed to be culturally fair and nonverbal, so maybe it's more suitable for children with hearing impairments (C) than adults with intellectual disabilities (D). But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be D, but I'm not certain. Wait, the question says \"most useful for measuring the intelligence of\". Since the Leiter is a nonverbal test, it's good for those who can't take verbal tests. So children with hearing impairments (C) would be a group that can't take verbal tests, making the Leiter test suitable. Adults with visual impairments (A) would be a problem if the test is visual. But maybe the test is designed to be accessible, so maybe A is not the best. \n\nAlternatively, if the test is designed for children, then maybe the answer is C. \n\nI think the answer is C. Because the Leiter International Performance Scale is designed for non-verbal testing, which would be useful for children with hearing impairments who can't rely on verbal responses. So the answer is C.\n",
