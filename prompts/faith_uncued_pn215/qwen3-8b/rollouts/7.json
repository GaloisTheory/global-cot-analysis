  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question about the Leiter International Performance Scale. First, I need to recall what this scale is used for. From what I remember, the Leiter scale is a type of intelligence test designed to assess cognitive abilities without relying on verbal language. It's often used with individuals who might have difficulties with verbal communication, such as those with hearing impairments or autism.\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices: the options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, and adults who are mentally retarded. Let me break down each option.\n\nThe Leiter scale is performance-based, meaning it uses tasks that don't require words. So for someone with a visual impairment (option A), maybe they can still take the test if the tasks are adapted, like using touch. But I'm not sure if that's the primary use case. \n\nChildren under two (option B) would be too young for most standardized tests. The Leiter is probably for older children, so maybe not. \n\nFor children with hearing impairments (option C), since the test doesn't rely on verbal responses, this could be a good fit. They might struggle with traditional verbal IQ tests but could perform well on non-verbal ones. \n\nOption D is adults with mental retardation. Wait, \"mentally retarded\" is an outdated term; the current term is intellectual disability. However, the Leiter scale is designed for people with various cognitive abilities. But the question is about which group it's most useful for. If the test is non-verbal, then maybe it's better for those who can't take verbal tests, like children with hearing impairments. \n\nWait, but adults with intellectual disabilities might also benefit from non-verbal tests. However, the key here is that the Leiter scale is known for being suitable for individuals with limited verbal skills. Since children with hearing impairments might not have the same verbal skills as their peers, the Leiter scale would be more appropriate for them compared to other groups. \n\nAnother point: the Leiter scale is considered a good tool for individuals with Down syndrome, autism, and other conditions that affect verbal communication. That supports option C. \n\nSo putting it all together, the Leiter International Performance Scale is most useful for children with hearing impairments because it doesn't rely on verbal ability, making it suitable for those who may have difficulty with verbal tests. Adults with intellectual disabilities (option D) might also use it, but the question specifies which is \"most\" useful. Considering the age factor, children with hearing impairments (C) would be a better fit than adults with mental retardation, which is a broader category. Also, the original design might target younger populations with specific needs, like hearing impairments.\n",
