  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question about the Leiter International Performance Scale. First, I need to recall what this scale is used for. From what I remember, the Leiter scale is a type of intelligence test designed for children, especially those who might have difficulty with traditional verbal tests. It's a non-verbal test, which means it doesn't rely on language, so it's useful for individuals who can't speak or have language barriers.\n\nNow, the question is asking which group this scale would be most useful for measuring intelligence. The options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, and adults who are mentally retarded. Let me go through each option.\n\nOption A: Adults with visual impairments. The Leiter scale is non-verbal, but does it address visual impairments? Well, if someone has a visual impairment, they might struggle with tests that require reading or visual symbols. However, the Leiter scale might use non-verbal tasks that don't require reading, but I'm not sure if it's specifically designed for visual impairments. Maybe there are other tests that are more tailored for that.\n\nOption B: Children under two. The Leiter scale is for children, but I think the age range is typically up to around 12 or so. Children under two might be too young for most standardized tests. However, maybe there's a version for younger children? I'm not certain. But the question is about the Leiter scale in general. Also, the scale might not be suitable for such young children because their cognitive development hasn't reached the necessary stage for testing.\n\nOption C: Children with hearing impairments. Since the Leiter scale is non-verbal, it doesn't rely on spoken language, which is a big plus for children with hearing impairments. They might not have the language skills to perform verbal tests, so a non-verbal test would be more appropriate. This seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption D: Adults who are mentally retarded. Wait, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated and offensive. The current term is \"intellectual disability.\" But regardless of the terminology, the Leiter scale is for children. It's designed for younger populations. Adults with intellectual disabilities might require different assessments, especially if they're adults. Also, the scale is used for children, so it's not the best for adults, even if they have intellectual disabilities.\n\nSo, putting this together: the Leiter International Performance Scale is a non-verbal, culture-fair test, suitable for children who can't take verbal tests. It's especially useful for those with hearing impairments (since it doesn't require language) and maybe those with visual impairments if the test uses non-visual tasks. But the key here is that the scale is for children. The question about children under two (option B) might be tricky. However, I think the Leiter scale is for children from a certain age up to around 12. If the question is about children under two, that's probably too young. So the best fit would be children with hearing impairments (option C) because the non-verbal nature of the test is beneficial for them, and the scale is designed for children. Adults with visual impairments (A) might not be the target group since the test is for children. Adults with intellectual disabilities (D) would not be the primary group either. Therefore, the answer is C.\n",
