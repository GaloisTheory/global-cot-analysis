  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question about the Leiter International Performance Scale. First, I need to remember what this scale is used for. From what I recall, the Leiter scale is a type of intelligence test designed to assess cognitive abilities. But I'm not exactly sure about its specific focus. Wait, isn't it a nonverbal test? That might be important because some people might have difficulties with verbal tasks.\n\nThe question asks which group the scale would be most useful for measuring. The options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, and adults who are mentally retarded. Let me think about each option.\n\nFirst, if the test is nonverbal, then maybe it's better for people with sensory impairments like visual or hearing issues. For example, someone with a visual impairment might struggle with tests that require reading or seeing symbols. But the Leiter scale might use different formats, maybe tactile or auditory cues. However, children under two might not be able to perform tasks that require complex understanding, so maybe not them. \n\nWait, the Leiter scale is known as a performance-based test, which doesn't rely on language. So for children under two, they might not have developed the necessary language skills yet, but maybe the test is designed for younger children. But the options here include children under two, which is very young. I think the Leiter scale is more suitable for older children and adults. \n\nThen there's the option of adults with mental retardation. But the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated; now it's called intellectual disability. But regardless, the test's purpose is to measure intelligence. If the test is nonverbal, it might be useful for those who have difficulty with verbal communication, which could include both individuals with hearing impairments (since they can't rely on spoken instructions) and those with visual impairments (if the test uses visual components). However, the question is about which group the scale is most useful for. \n\nWait, the Leiter scale is often used for children with developmental disabilities, including those with hearing impairments, because it doesn't require verbal responses. Alternatively, for adults with intellectual disabilities, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. \n\nIf the test is nonverbal, then it would be suitable for people who have trouble with verbal tasks. So, children with hearing impairments (since they might not understand spoken instructions) could benefit from a nonverbal test. Similarly, adults with visual impairments might have trouble with tests that use visual elements. However, the Leiter scale is designed to be culturally fair, meaning it's not dependent on language or cultural knowledge. \n\nBut the answer choices might have a better fit. For example, children under two might not be able to take an intelligence test at all, as they're too young. So option B is probably not correct. Adults with mental retardation (now called intellectual disability) would require a test that's appropriate for their level, but I don't know if the Leiter specifically targets that. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is in the name: \"Performance Scale.\" This might indicate that it's a performance-based test, which is useful for those who can't take traditional verbal tests. So for children with hearing impairments, since they can't rely on verbal components, a performance-based test would be better. Alternatively, adults with visual impairments might also benefit if the test has alternative formats. \n\nBut the question is asking which group the scale would be most useful for. Maybe the answer is A or C. However, I'm not entirely certain. Let me check my memory. I think the Leiter scale is often used for children with hearing impairments because it doesn't require verbal responses. So even if they have hearing impairments, they can still perform tasks that involve motor skills or visual tasks. Alternatively, if the test is designed for nonverbal assessment, then it could work for both hearing and visual impairments. \n\nBut the answer options don't have both A and C. Let me think again. The original question says the Leiter International Performance Scale is used for measuring intelligence. So for which group would it be most useful? Maybe it's designed for children with hearing impairments because they need nonverbal assessments. Alternatively, maybe for adults with mental retardation? No, that seems less likely. Wait, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated, but the test could be used for individuals with intellectual disabilities. However, the options are phrased in a way that might suggest that the test is designed to be used when verbal tests aren't possible. \n\nAlternatively, considering that children under two are too young for standard IQ tests, but the Leiter scale is for children, so maybe B is not the answer. \n\nI think the best answer is either A or C. Since the Leiter scale is a nonverbal test, it's suitable for those who have sensory impairments. However, if the test includes visual components, then adults with visual impairments would struggle. But if the test includes tactile or other modalities, maybe it's better for them. However, I think that the Leiter scale is more commonly associated with children with hearing impairments because they can't take verbal tests. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B. Wait, no. Children under two are too young for any standardized intelligence test. Therefore, B is not correct. \n\nSo between A, C, D. Adults who are mentally retarded (D) would need a test that can measure their intelligence without relying on verbal skills. However, the Leiter scale might be used for that. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the Leiter scale is known for being a nonverbal, culture-fair test that can be used with individuals who have limited verbal abilities. Therefore, it would be most useful for children with hearing impairments (C) because they can't rely on spoken language. Or for adults with visual impairments (A) if the test uses tactile methods. However, the answer choices don't specify. \n\nHmm. I think I need to recall that the Leiter scale is often used for children with hearing impairments. Therefore, the answer is C. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is D. No, because the term \"mentally retarded\" suggests intellectual disability, which is a different category. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the Leiter scale is a performance test, it's more suitable for groups that may not have verbal skills, so children with hearing impairments (C) or adults with visual impairments (A). But since the answer options don't have both, I need to choose. \n\nWait, another angle: the Leiter scale is designed to be used with individuals who cannot take traditional verbal tests, such as those with severe language disorders. So for children with hearing impairments, which would affect their ability to understand spoken instructions, the nonverbal test would be better. Therefore, the answer is C. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (C).\n",
