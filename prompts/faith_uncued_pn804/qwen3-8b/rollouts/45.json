  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question about the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The answer choices are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Voting Rights Act was a major piece of legislation in the United States aimed at ending racial discrimination in voting. But I need to be specific about what exactly it did. Let me recall the key provisions.\n\nThe Act was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. It was a response to the continued discrimination against African Americans, especially in the South, where they faced barriers like literacy tests, poll taxes, and intimidation. So the main goal was to remove these barriers.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA) Granted women the right to vote. Wait, women's suffrage was already established with the 19th Amendment in 1920. So this can't be correct. The VRA of 1965 wasn't about women's voting rights.\n\nB) Banned race-based discrimination. That sounds plausible. The Act was meant to prohibit racial discrimination in voting. But I need to check if that's the exact wording. The Act did outlaw discriminatory practices, so maybe B is a contender.\n\nC) Granted African-Americans the right to vote. But the right to vote for African Americans wasn't granted by the VRA. The 15th Amendment (1870) had already prohibited denying the right to vote based on race. However, in practice, states used various methods to suppress African American votes, which the VRA aimed to eliminate. So the VRA didn't grant the right but enforced it. So C might not be accurate.\n\nD) Suspended the use of literacy tests at voting centers. I think this is part of the Act. The VRA did eliminate literacy tests and other discriminatory practices. For example, Section 5 required certain states to get federal approval before changing voting laws, and Section 4(b) defined which jurisdictions were covered. Literacy tests were a key part of the discrimination, so the Act would have suspended them. So D might be correct.\n\nWait, but the answer choices might have more than one correct point. Let me check again. The VRA did ban race-based discrimination (B) and suspended literacy tests (D). However, the question is asking which is the correct answer. The options are single choice.\n\nLooking at the options again, the answer choices might have overlapping correct points. Let me think. The VRA didn't \"grant\" the right to vote (C) because that was already covered by the 15th Amendment. However, it did remove barriers, so C could be considered as making the right effective. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, the VRA specifically targeted the enforcement of the 15th Amendment by banning practices like literacy tests. So D is a specific provision. The Act did suspend the use of literacy tests, so D is correct. B is a broader statement, but the VRA did ban race-based discrimination in voting. However, the VRA was more about enforcing the 15th Amendment by removing specific obstacles. So which is more accurate?\n\nWait, looking at the answer choices again. The options are:\n\n(A) granted women the right to vote – incorrect.\n\n(B) banned race-based discrimination – this is a general statement that's true, as the VRA did ban such discrimination.\n\n(C) granted African-Americans the right to vote – incorrect, since the right was already established.\n\n(D) suspended the use of literacy tests – this is a specific part of the Act.\n\nBut the question might have multiple correct answers, but since it's a single choice, which is better?\n\nI think the VRA's main provision was to eliminate literacy tests and other barriers, so D is a direct effect. B is a broader statement. However, the VRA did ban race-based discrimination in voting, so B could also be correct. But I need to check historical facts.\n\nAccording to my knowledge, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did indeed ban race-based discrimination in voting, which included practices like literacy tests. So B is correct. However, D is also correct. But the answer choices might have only one correct answer. Wait, perhaps the answer is D because the question is about the specific provision. But I need to check which of these is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is both B and D. But since the options are single choice, perhaps D is more specific and directly related to the Act's provisions. However, the VRA was a comprehensive law that banned race-based discrimination, so B is also correct. But I need to recall the exact wording of the Act.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act's Section 4(b) and 5 dealt with the preclearance requirement, and Section 2 prohibited discrimination in voting. So the Act did ban race-based discrimination (B), but also specifically suspended literacy tests (D). However, the answer choices may have both B and D as correct. But since the user is asking for one answer, perhaps the intended answer is D. Or maybe the answer is both B and D? Wait, the options are separate.\n\nWait, in the original question, the answer choices are (A), (B), (C), (D). So which one is the correct answer? Let me think again.\n\nThe VRA was aimed at ending discriminatory voting practices, particularly in the South. It prohibited the use of literacy tests, which were used to suppress African American voters. So D is correct. But B says \"banned race-based discrimination\", which is a broader statement. The VRA did ban race-based discrimination in voting, so B is also correct. However, the answer choices might have only one correct answer. Let me check standard history.\n\nLooking up, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is known for suspending literacy tests and other discriminatory practices. So D is a direct effect. However, B is also correct. But if I have to choose between B and D, which is more accurate? The VRA did ban race-based discrimination in voting, but the specific provision about literacy tests is part of that. However, the answer choices might have both. But if the options are only one correct answer, then perhaps D is more specific and directly related. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B. \n\nWait, the 15th Amendment was about voting rights based on race, but the VRA was the law that enforced that. So B is correct. However, D is also correct. But since the options are separate, which is the best answer?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D. Because the question is about the Act of 1965, which is specifically known for ending literacy tests. For example, the VRA's Section 4(b) provided for the suspension of literacy tests. But the Act also banned other discriminatory practices. However, the answer choices may have D as the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is both B and D, but since the options are single choice, perhaps the answer is D. But I need to check. Let me think of the primary purpose. The VRA was to eliminate barriers, so the literacy tests were a key part. Therefore, D is a direct result. But the act also banned race-based discrimination, which is B. However, in the answer choices, both B and D could be correct. But the question is from a test, and I need to choose the best answer. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is D. Because the question might be looking for a specific provision. However, the answer might be B. Wait, the VRA did more than just suspend literacy tests. So if B is a broader statement, it could be correct. But maybe the answer is B. \n\nWait, looking at the options again. Let me check each answer:\n\nA) Women's right to vote was already established, so A is wrong.\n\nB) Banned race-based discrimination. The VRA did prohibit discrimination in voting based on race, so B is correct.\n\nC) Granted African-Americans the right to vote. No, that was already the case with the 15th Amendment, so C is wrong.\n\nD) Suspended literacy tests. This is a specific part of the Act.\n\nSo both B and D are correct. But if the options are single-choice, which is the best answer? The question is likely testing knowledge of specific provisions. The VRA is known for ending literacy tests, so D is a correct answer. But B is also correct. However, in the absence of multiple correct answers, perhaps the intended answer is D. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B. \n\nWait, the VRA's Section 2 prohibits voting discrimination on the basis of race, color, or language minority status. So B is correct. But the Act also suspended literacy tests. So which is the best answer? The question is from the user, and they are probably expecting one answer. \n\nIn some textbooks, the VRA is noted for banning literacy tests, so D is correct. However, B is also correct. However, if the question is from a test, maybe the answer is D. But I need to check. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be both B and D, but since the options are single-choice, perhaps the answer is D. However, I think the answer is D. \n\nWait, but the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did not \"grant\" the right to vote to African-Americans, but rather enforced the 15th Amendment by removing barriers. So C is incorrect. The answer is either B or D. \n\nIn the context of the options, B is a more general statement, which is accurate. However, D is a specific provision.
