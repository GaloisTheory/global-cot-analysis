  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question about the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The question is asking which of the answer choices is correct. The options are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did. From what I remember, this act was a major piece of legislation in the United States aimed at ending racial discrimination in voting. It was a key part of the Civil Rights Movement. \n\nLet me go through each option one by one. \n\nOption A says it granted women the right to vote. Wait, I think women's suffrage was established much earlier. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1920, so that's way before 1965. So A is probably not correct. \n\nOption B states it banned race-based discrimination. That sounds plausible because the act was about ending discrimination in voting, especially against African Americans. But I should check if the act specifically banned race-based discrimination or if it targeted certain practices. \n\nOption C claims it granted African-Americans the right to vote. But wait, the right to vote for African-Americans wasn't granted by this act. The 15th Amendment, passed in 1870, already prohibited the denial of voting rights based on race. However, in practice, Jim Crow laws and other discriminatory practices in the South prevented many African-Americans from voting. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was meant to enforce the 15th Amendment by removing barriers like literacy tests and other discriminatory practices. So C might be a partial truth but not entirely accurate because the right to vote was already established, but the act made it enforceable.\n\nOption D says it suspended the use of literacy tests at voting centers. I think this is correct. The Voting Rights Act did eliminate literacy tests, which were commonly used in Southern states to disenfranchise African-American voters. The act required jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to get federal approval before changing their voting laws, and it also suspended literacy tests. \n\nSo putting this together: the main purpose of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was to eliminate racial discrimination in voting, particularly through the removal of literacy tests. Therefore, D is correct. Option B is also related, but the act specifically targeted practices like literacy tests, not just banning race-based discrimination in a general sense. \n\nWait, but the question is about the correct answer. Let me check again. The act did ban race-based discrimination in voting, but the specific answer D is about literacy tests. Which is more accurate? The act's main provisions included the suspension of literacy tests, which was a key part of the legislation. So D is a specific part of the act. \n\nTherefore, the best answer would be D. However, I should also check if B is a possible answer. The act did ban race-based discrimination in voting, but the question might have multiple correct points. However, the answer options are single-choice. \n\nLooking back, the correct answer is D. Because the act specifically suspended literacy tests. Option C is incorrect because the right to vote was already established. Option B is a broader statement, but the act's main provision was about literacy tests. So D is the best answer.\n",
