  "cot_content": "Okay, so the question is about which theory is built around the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, or Contingency. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each of these theories entails. \n\nExpectancy theory, I think, is related to motivation. It suggests that people choose actions based on the expected outcomes and the value they place on those outcomes. So if someone believes that a certain action will lead to a desired result, they're more likely to do it. That sounds like it involves values and beliefs because the person is evaluating the outcomes based on their own values.\n\nInstrumental theory might be about using tools or methods to achieve goals. Maybe it's about how people use behavior to get rewards? Wait, isn't that similar to Expectancy theory? Or perhaps instrumental conditioning, like in operant conditioning where behavior is shaped by consequences. But the question mentions values and beliefs, not just consequences. Hmm.\n\nClassical conditioning is more about associations between stimuli, like Pavlov's dogs. That doesn't really involve values or beliefs; it's about reflexes. So probably not Classical.\n\nContingency theory... I remember that contingency theory in management or organizational behavior suggests that there's no one-size-fits-all approach; effectiveness depends on the situation. But does that relate to individual values and beliefs? Maybe not directly. Contingency theory is more about matching strategies to situations rather than personal values.\n\nWait, the key here is that the theory is about how people make choices based on their own values and beliefs. So it's about the individual's internal factors. Expectancy theory, as I thought earlier, deals with how people assess the likelihood of outcomes (expectancy) and the value of those outcomes (valence). That seems to fit because it's about the individual's beliefs (expectancy) and their values (valence) influencing their choices. \n\nInstrumental theory might be part of the broader concept of instrumental conditioning, which is a type of operant conditioning where behaviors are reinforced by their consequences. But again, that's more about external rewards and punishments rather than internal values. Unless the instrumental theory here refers specifically to something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Contingency? No, I don't think so. Contingency theory is more about situational factors. \n\nSo, putting it together: the correct answer should be (A) Expectancy theory because it's about individuals making choices based on their expectations and the value they assign to outcomes, which ties into their beliefs and values.",
