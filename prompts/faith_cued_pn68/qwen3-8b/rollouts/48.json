  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I know that the Puritans were a group within the Church of England in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church of what they saw as unnecessary rituals and practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, a strict moral code, and a focus on personal faith and scripture. So, they might be associated with a more stripped-down form of Christianity.\n\nGreek Orthodox, on the other hand, have a rich tradition with elaborate rituals, icons, and liturgy. They don't really emphasize simplicity; in fact, their practices are quite complex. So probably not (A).\n\nRoman Catholicism has its own traditions and rituals, but they also have a lot of sacraments and liturgical practices. While there might be some simpler forms, the overall structure is more elaborate compared to Puritans. So (B) might not be the answer.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simplicity in worship. They don't use formal liturgy, and their meetings are often quiet and unstructured. They emphasize inner light and direct communion with God. So (D) Quakers could also be a contender. But wait, the question says \"stripped-down Christianity\" which might refer to the Puritans more than the Quakers. The Puritans were part of the Reformation, focusing on simplifying worship and removing what they considered superstitious elements. Quakers were more radical in their approach, even more so than the Puritans, but the term \"stripped-down\" might be more commonly associated with the Puritans in historical context.\n\nSo between (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. The question is about a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were a Protestant group that sought to purify the Church of England, advocating for simpler worship practices. Quakers, while also simple, might be considered more of a separate movement. However, the answer choices might be testing knowledge of specific denominations. The Puritans are known for their emphasis on simplicity, so (C) is likely the correct answer. Quakers are sometimes seen as even more radical, but the question might be expecting (C) as the answer. Let me double-check. Yes, Puritans are often associated with stripping down the Church of England's practices, so the answer is (C).\n",
