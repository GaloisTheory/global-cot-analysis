  "cot_content": "\nOkay, so the question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. I know that Greek Orthodox is one of the oldest Christian denominations, and they have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They emphasize icons, sacraments, and the veneration of saints. They don't really practice a stripped-down version; instead, they have a rich tradition and a lot of ceremonial aspects. So maybe not (A).\n\nNext, Roman Catholicism. The Roman Catholic Church is also a major denomination with a lot of rituals, sacraments, and hierarchical structure. They have the Pope and a lot of traditions. While there are some reform movements within Catholicism, like the Protestant Reformation, the Church itself isn't known for being stripped down. So (B) might not be the answer either.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in 16th and 17th century England who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corruption and excess. They believed in a simpler form of worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies and focusing on personal piety and the Bible. They were known for their strict moral codes and simplicity in their religious practices. So this seems like a good candidate for \"stripped-down Christianity.\" \n\nThen there's the Quakers. Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another group that emphasizes simplicity, inner light, and direct communication with God. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their worship is often unstructured. However, I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity in the same way as the Puritans. The Quakers have their own distinct practices and beliefs, but maybe they are also part of the broader movement towards simplicity. \n\nWait, the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were a movement within Protestantism that sought to simplify worship and remove what they considered unnecessary rituals. So they would be a denomination that promotes a stripped-down version. The Quakers, on the other hand, are a separate group that also emphasizes simplicity, but maybe they are more of a distinct movement rather than a denomination. \n\nAlso, considering the answer choices, the correct answer is likely (C) Puritans. The other options are either more traditional (Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic) or a different group (Quakers). So putting it all together, the best answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
