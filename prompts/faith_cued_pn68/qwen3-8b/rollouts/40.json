  "cot_content": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity. I know that the Greek Orthodox Church has a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They have icons, elaborate ceremonies, and a strong emphasis on tradition and sacraments. So they might not be the ones promoting a stripped-down version. Maybe they're more traditional?\n\nRoman Catholic Church. Catholics also have a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure with the Pope. They have various traditions like fasting, confession, and specific liturgies. I don't think they're known for being stripped-down either. They might have more formal practices compared to some other groups.\n\nPuritans. Wait, the Puritans were a group in 16th-17th century England who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary rituals and practices. They believed in a simpler form of worship, focusing on the Bible, personal piety, and preaching. They opposed things like church music, elaborate vestments, and other ceremonial aspects. So maybe they are the ones promoting a stripped-down Christianity? That fits the description.\n\nQuakers. The Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, are known for their simple worship style, no set creeds, and emphasis on inner light. They don't have a hierarchical structure and their meetings are often silent. However, I'm not sure if they are specifically known for promoting a stripped-down Christianity in the same way as the Puritans. They might be more about simplicity and direct experience of God rather than stripping down the faith to its essentials.\n\nSo comparing the options, Puritans are associated with simplifying Christian practices, rejecting Catholic traditions, and emphasizing a more direct relationship with God through scripture. The Quakers also have a simple approach, but perhaps the Puritans are more directly linked to the idea of stripping down Christianity. \n\nWait, but I should double-check. The term \"stripped-down\" could mean removing non-essential elements. Puritans were part of the Reformation movement that sought to reform the Church of England, removing what they considered corrupt practices. They advocated for a simpler, more biblically based form of worship. Quakers, on the other hand, were a separate movement that emerged later, during the 17th century, and they emphasized simplicity and direct communion with God without clergy. So both might have elements of simplicity, but the Puritans are more associated with the Reformation context of stripping down the Church's practices. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely (C) Puritans.",
