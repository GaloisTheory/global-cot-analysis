  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this question. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox. I know that Greek Orthodox is a branch of Eastern Christianity. They have a lot of traditions, like icons, specific liturgical practices, and a strong emphasis on tradition and the sacraments. They probably don't emphasize a stripped-down version of Christianity because they have a rich ceremonial life.\n\nThen there's Roman Catholicism. The Roman Catholic Church is the largest Christian denomination. They have a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure with the Pope. They also have a lot of traditions and practices. So maybe they aren't the ones promoting a stripped-down version either. \n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in 16th and 17th century England. They were Protestants who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, strict moral codes, and a focus on the Bible. They believed in a more direct relationship with God without the elaborate rituals. So maybe they are the ones who promoted a stripped-down Christianity. \n\nQuakers, on the other hand, are another Protestant denomination. They are known for their emphasis on inner light, simplicity, and direct communion with God. They don't have a formal clergy, and their services are usually very simple. So Quakers also have a stripped-down approach. Wait, but the question is about which denomination promotes that. \n\nNow, I need to compare Puritans and Quakers. The Puritans were more focused on reforming the Church of England, while Quakers were a separate movement. The Puritans were more about simplifying worship and rejecting ceremonial aspects, which aligns with stripped-down Christianity. Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but maybe the term \"stripped-down\" is more associated with the Puritans because of their historical context of reform and rejecting Catholic practices. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely (C) Puritans. The other options have more elaborate traditions. The Quakers are also simple, but maybe the Puritans are more recognized for that aspect. The Stanford Professor's answer was (C), so I should confirm that. Yeah, I think that's right.\n",
