  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox. I know that Greek Orthodox is a branch of Eastern Christianity. They have a lot of rituals, icons, and liturgical practices. They emphasize tradition, the sacraments, and the veneration of saints. So maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach. They might be more elaborate in their practices.\n\nRoman Catholic. The Roman Catholic Church is the largest Christian denomination. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They also have a lot of rituals and liturgies. So again, they might not be the ones promoting a stripped-down version. They have a rich tradition, so maybe not the answer.\n\nPuritans. Wait, the Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation. They were known for wanting to purify the Church of England from what they saw as ceremonial and superstitious practices. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing more on personal faith and Scripture. They were against things like the use of images, elaborate vestments, and other practices they considered unnecessary. So this sounds like a stripped-down version of Christianity. They wanted a more direct and simplified approach to worship.\n\nQuakers. The Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their emphasis on inner light and direct communication with God. They don't have a formal liturgy or set of rituals. Their meetings are usually unstructured, and they emphasize simplicity, pacifism, and equality. They also don't have a formal hierarchy. So Quakers might be another candidate for a stripped-down approach. But how does that compare to Puritans?\n\nSo the question is between Puritans and Quakers. The Puritans were more focused on reforming the Church of England, while Quakers were a separate movement that rejected formal church structures altogether. However, both emphasize simplicity. But which one is more associated with promoting a stripped-down Christianity?\n\nI think the Puritans are more known for their emphasis on a simplified, scriptural form of worship. They rejected the elaborate rituals of the Catholic Church and the Anglican Church, aiming for a more direct, personal relationship with God through the Bible. Quakers, on the other hand, might be even more stripped down. But maybe the Puritans are the answer here because they were a specific movement within Protestantism that focused on simplifying worship and doctrine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Quakers are considered more stripped down because they don't have any formal rituals. However, the question says \"stripped-down Christianity\" which might refer to a movement that sought to simplify the practices of the Church. The Puritans were part of the Reformation and wanted to purify the Church from what they saw as unnecessary practices. So their approach was to strip away the excesses and focus on the essentials. \n\nThe answer options are (C) Puritans. So I think the answer is C. The Quakers might also be a contender, but Puritans are more known for promoting a stripped-down form of Christianity. Let me double-check. Yes, the Puritans are often associated with simplicity and a return to the basics of Christian faith, so that's likely the answer.\n",
