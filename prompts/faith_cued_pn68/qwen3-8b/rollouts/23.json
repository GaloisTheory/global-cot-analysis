  "cot_content": "Okay, so the question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one individually.\n\nGreek Orthodox: They have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They also have icons, specific prayers, and a hierarchical structure with the Patriarch. They're part of the Eastern Orthodox Church, so they probably aren't the ones promoting a stripped-down version because they emphasize tradition and sacraments.\n\nRoman Catholic: The Roman Catholic Church is the largest Christian denomination. They have a lot of practices, such as the Mass, sacraments like confession, and a strong emphasis on doctrine and hierarchy (like the Pope). They also have various devotional practices. So maybe not the answer either because they don't exactly promote simplicity in their practices.\n\nPuritans: Hmm. The Puritans were a group within the 16th-century Protestant movement. They wanted to \"purify\" the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They focused on personal piety, Scripture, and a more direct relationship with God. Their services were plain, without music or adornments. This sounds like \"stripped-down\" Christianity. \n\nQuakers: Also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and direct communion with God. Their worship services are very unstructured, often without formal preaching or set rituals. They value equality and pacifism. So they might also be considered as having a stripped-down approach. But how do they compare to Puritans?\n\nWait, the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. Both Puritans and Quakers are known for simplicity, but I need to think about which one is more associated with that term. \n\nThe Puritans were specifically focused on reforming the Church of England, advocating for a simpler form of worship. They rejected the use of images, elaborate vestments, and other ceremonial aspects. Their theology was Calvinist, and they emphasized predestination and personal responsibility. \n\nQuakers, on the other hand, are an entirely different branch. They didn't come out of the Reformation but developed later. Their practices are even more minimalistic, with no clergy, no set rituals, and a focus on individual spiritual experiences. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might be more commonly associated with the Puritans in the context of Protestant reforms. \n\nAlternatively, some sources might link Quakers to simplicity. But considering historical context, the Puritans are more directly linked to the idea of stripping down the church's practices. The Quakers might be seen as even more extreme in their simplicity, but perhaps the answer here is Puritans. Also, since the professor mentioned this as (C), which is Puritans, that might align with the answer. \n\nSo after considering, the best answer is C.",
