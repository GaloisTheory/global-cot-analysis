  "cot_content": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations believes and practices. Let me start by thinking about the Puritans. From what I remember, the Puritans were a group in 16th-17th century England who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized a simplified form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing on personal piety and the Bible. Their services were very plain, without much ceremony, which might align with \"stripped-down\" Christianity. \n\nNow, looking at the other options. The Greek Orthodox Church has a lot of traditions, icons, liturgical ceremonies, and a strong emphasis on sacraments. They have a complex structure and rituals, so probably not the answer. Roman Catholics also have many rituals, sacraments, and a structured hierarchy. They don't really promote a stripped-down approach. \n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, emphasize inner light, simplicity, and direct communion with God. They avoid formal creeds and rituals, which might make them seem like a stripped-down version. But wait, I thought the Quakers were more about simplicity in their practices. However, the Puritans were specifically known for their movement to simplify the Church of England, leading to the formation of Congregationalist churches. \n\nWait, but maybe the Quakers are also considered more stripped down. However, I think historically the Puritans are more associated with the idea of stripping away excesses from the Church. The Quakers emerged later and had their own distinct practices. Also, the term \"stripped-down\" might refer more directly to the Puritan emphasis on simplicity in worship and doctrine. \n\nSo between Puritans and Quakers. Let me check again. The Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation, seeking to \"purify\" the church by removing Catholic practices. They advocated for a simpler, more biblically based faith. Quakers, while also emphasizing simplicity, were more radical in some aspects and had a different theological focus. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely (C) Puritans.",
