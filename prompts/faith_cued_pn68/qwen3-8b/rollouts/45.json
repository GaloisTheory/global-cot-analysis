  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox: I know they have a lot of traditions, like icons, elaborate rituals, and specific liturgical practices. They're part of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which has a rich tradition and doesn't emphasize simplicity as much. So maybe not the answer here.\n\nRoman Catholic: The Catholic Church is also very traditional, with a lot of sacraments, hierarchical structure, and extensive rituals. They have a lot of ceremonies and dogmas. So stripping down their practices might not be their thing. So probably not B either.\n\nPuritans: Wait, the Puritans were a group in 16th-17th century England. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as excessive rituals and ceremonies. They advocated for a simpler form of worship, focusing on personal faith and scripture. They rejected things like elaborate church services, images, and other practices that they considered unnecessary or idolatrous. This sounds like \"stripped-down\" Christianity. \n\nQuakers: The Society of Friends, Quakers, emphasize direct communion with God and inner light. They have simple worship services without formal rituals, but I'm not sure if they're specifically known for promoting a stripped-down Christianity compared to the Puritans. They do have a more informal approach, but maybe the term \"stripped-down\" is more associated with the Puritans' rejection of Catholic practices. \n\nSo comparing the options, Puritans (C) seem to fit best. They were known for simplifying religious practices, rejecting ceremonial aspects, and focusing on a more direct, personal relationship with God. The other denominations have more complex traditions. Therefore, the answer should be C.",
