  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start with the Greek Orthodox. I know they have a lot of traditions, icons, rituals, and a hierarchical structure with the Patriarch. They also have a rich liturgical tradition, so maybe they're not the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nThen there's the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of sacraments, a centralized authority in the Pope, and various traditions. They also have a lot of rituals and doctrines, so I don't think they're considered stripped-down either. \n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Church of England who wanted to purify the church of what they saw as unnecessary rituals and practices. They believed in a simpler form of worship, focusing more on the Bible and personal faith. They were known for their Calvinist beliefs and strict moral codes. So this seems like a possibility for a stripped-down Christianity.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They emphasize personal experience of God, simplicity, and direct communication with the divine. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their services are usually unstructured, focusing on silence and individual responses. They also value simplicity in their lifestyle and worship. So Quakers might also be a candidate here.\n\nNow, which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity? The Puritans were definitely known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship and rejecting elaborate rituals. Quakers also emphasize simplicity, but I think the Puritans are more specifically associated with the idea of stripping away the excesses of the Church, like the elaborate rituals of the Anglican Church. The Puritans were part of the Reformation movement, which sought to reform the Church by simplifying practices. Quakers were also part of the Protestant movement, but they were more radical in some aspects, like rejecting formal creeds and sacraments. However, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more directly associated with the Puritans because they were known for their focus on a pure, simple form of Christianity, as opposed to the more elaborate practices of other denominations. \n\nWait, but I should check if Quakers are considered as promoting a stripped-down version. Quakers do have a very simple structure, no clergy, no set liturgy, and emphasize inner light. However, the question might be looking for a group that specifically advocated for a stripped-down form of Christianity, which would be the Puritans. The Puritans are often seen as promoting a more austere and simplified version of Protestantism, especially in contrast to the Catholic Church and other Protestant denominations. Quakers, while simple, are perhaps more associated with a different kind of simplicity, like in their lifestyle and community practices. \n\nSo, considering the options, the Puritans (C) are the ones who promoted a stripped-down Christianity. The answer is C.\n",
