  "cot_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They are part of Eastern Christianity, right? They have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They also have a strong emphasis on icons, sacraments, and the veneration of saints. So I don't think they're known for being stripped down. Maybe more elaborate?\n\nThen there's the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of sacraments, hierarchical structure, papal authority, and various traditions. They do have some liturgical practices, but again, not sure if they're considered stripped down. They might be more structured than some other groups, but maybe not the most stripped down.\n\nNext, the Puritans. From what I remember, the Puritans were a group within Protestantism in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting things like elaborate ceremonies, music, and ornamentation. They focused on personal piety, Scripture, and a direct relationship with God. So this sounds like stripped-down Christianity. They might be the answer here.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They are known for their simple worship, no formal clergy, and emphasis on inner light. They do have a very plain style of worship, minimal rituals, and focus on spiritual equality. But how does that compare to the Puritans? Both have elements of simplicity, but I think the Puritans are more associated with the Reformation and stripping away Catholic practices. Quakers were a different movement, more towards the 17th century, but maybe similar in some aspects.\n\nWait, but the question says \"stripped-down Christianity.\" The Puritans were definitely known for wanting to simplify the church services, remove anything they considered unnecessary, like elaborate vestments, music, and even the use of the Book of Common Prayer. They focused on preaching, Bible study, and personal religious experience. Quakers also emphasize simplicity, but perhaps their approach is different. However, the Puritans' emphasis on a stripped-down faith aligns well with the term \"stripped-down Christianity.\"\n\nSo comparing the options, Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic are more traditional and elaborate, Quakers are simpler but maybe not as focused on stripping down the entire structure. The Puritans are directly associated with simplifying the church, so I think the answer is (C) Puritans.",
