  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start with the Greek Orthodox. I know that Greek Orthodox Christianity is one of the oldest branches, and they have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They have icons, elaborate ceremonies, and a strong emphasis on sacraments. So maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nNext, the Roman Catholic Church. They are also a major denomination with a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They have a lot of rituals and sacraments like confession, communion, etc. They also have a lot of liturgical practices. So I don't think they're the answer either. Maybe they're more about tradition than stripped-down.\n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Church of England in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church of what they saw as unnecessary rituals and excesses. They believed in a simpler form of worship, focusing on the Bible and personal faith. They rejected things like elaborate church services and emphasized preaching and personal Bible study. That sounds like a stripped-down approach. So maybe the Puritans are the answer.\n\nLastly, the Quakers. Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simple worship practices, lack of formal hierarchy, and emphasis on inner light. They don't have a structured liturgy, and their meetings are often silent, with individuals sharing spontaneously. They also tend to have a more egalitarian structure. But I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination that promotes a stripped-down Christianity. They might be more about simplicity, but I'm not certain if they are the best fit here.\n\nComparing the Puritans and Quakers, the Puritans were specifically focused on purifying the church from what they saw as excessive rituals, which aligns with a stripped-down approach. The Quakers also have simple practices, but they are a separate movement that emerged later. The question is about a denomination, so Puritans were a Protestant movement within the Church of England, while Quakers are a distinct group. So maybe the answer is Puritans.\n\nWait, but the options are (C) Puritans. So the answer might be C. Let me double-check. The Puritans did emphasize simplicity, rejecting the elaborate ceremonies of the Anglican Church, which was part of their push for a more \"pure\" form of Christianity. That matches the idea of stripped-down Christianity. Quakers also have simple practices, but they are more about direct experience of God without intermediaries, which is different. So the Puritans are more about simplifying church practices. Therefore, the answer is C.\n",
