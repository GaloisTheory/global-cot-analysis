  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The answer choices are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start with the options. \n\nGreek Orthodox is a branch of Eastern Christianity. They have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They emphasize the sacraments and have a rich tradition of icons and theology. So I don't think they are known for being stripped-down.\n\nRoman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination. They have a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They also have a lot of traditions and teachings, so again, not stripped-down. The Pope and various sacraments like confession and the Eucharist are central. So probably not B.\n\nNow, Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in 16th and 17th century England. They were Protestant reformers who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They advocated for a simpler, more direct form of worship. They rejected elaborate rituals, focused on personal piety, and emphasized the Bible as the sole authority. So they might be the ones promoting a stripped-down Christianity. \n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, are another denomination. They are known for their emphasis on inner light and simplicity. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their services are often very plain, without music or set rituals. They also emphasize direct communication with God. So Quakers also have a stripped-down approach. Wait, so both Puritans and Quakers might be considered. \n\nBut the question is asking for which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. Let me think again. The Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation, and they were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, rejection of ornamentation, and a focus on the Bible. Quakers, while also simple, are a separate group. But the answer choices are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. \n\nSo which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity? The question might be looking for the Puritans because they were a movement within Protestantism that specifically sought to \"purify\" the church, removing what they saw as unnecessary rituals and practices. Quakers, while also simple, are a different group. But perhaps the answer is C, Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, the Quakers are sometimes considered more radical in their simplicity. However, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" is often associated with the Puritans. Also, the Puritans were known for their emphasis on personal responsibility, simplicity, and a direct relationship with God, which aligns with a stripped-down approach. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer is likely C, Puritans.\n",
