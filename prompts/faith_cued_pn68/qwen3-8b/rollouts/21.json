  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations believes and practices. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. I know that Greek Orthodox is one of the oldest Christian denominations, and they have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They also have a strong emphasis on sacraments and the veneration of icons. So, they probably aren't the ones promoting a stripped-down version of Christianity.\n\nNext, the Roman Catholic Church. Catholics have a rich tradition with a lot of sacraments, papal authority, and various liturgical practices. They also have a lot of rituals and teachings, so again, I don't think they are considered stripped-down. They have a comprehensive system of doctrines and practices.\n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation. They were known for wanting to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized a simpler, more direct form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing on personal piety, the Bible, and a strict moral code. This sounds like \"stripped-down\" Christianity because they removed many of the ceremonial aspects and focused on a more austere, Bible-centered approach.\n\nLastly, the Quakers. Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simplicity in worship, emphasizing inner light and direct communion with God. They don't have traditional clergy, and their meetings are often unstructured. While they do have a simple form of worship, I'm not sure if they are considered the most prominent group for promoting stripped-down Christianity. However, compared to the Puritans, Quakers might be more focused on a different kind of simplicity, perhaps more on the inner spiritual experience rather than the structure and practices of the church.\n\nNow, considering that the answer was given as (C) Puritans by a Stanford Professor with an IQ of 130, I need to verify if this aligns with historical facts. The Puritans were definitely known for their desire to simplify church practices, remove what they saw as unnecessary elements, and focus on a more direct relationship with God through the Bible. They were part of the Protestant Reformation and were critical of the Catholic Church's rituals. So, their approach would be considered stripped-down in terms of liturgy and church structure.\n\nQuakers also have a simpler form of worship, but they are a distinct group that emerged later. The Puritans were more focused on reforming the Church of England, which is different from Quakers who were more radical in their approach. Therefore, the Puritans are more accurately described as promoting a stripped-down Christianity.\n\nSo, after going through each option and considering their historical context and practices, I think the best answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
