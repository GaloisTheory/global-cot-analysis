  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They are known for their rich traditions, elaborate rituals, and liturgical practices. They have a lot of sacraments and a hierarchical structure with the Patriarch. So they probably aren't the ones promoting a stripped-down version.\n\nThen there's the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a complex structure with the Pope. They also have a lot of rituals and liturgical practices. So similar to Greek Orthodox, they might not be the answer either.\n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Anglican Church in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies and hierarchical structures. They focused on personal piety, scripture, and a more direct relationship with God. This sounds like a stripped-down version of Christianity, focusing on the essentials and rejecting excess.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, also emphasize simplicity and direct experience of God. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their meetings are often unstructured. However, I think Quakers are more about spiritual equality and inner light rather than necessarily a stripped-down version. They might have some elements of simplicity, but the Puritans are more known for their reformist approach to reducing Catholic practices.\n\nSo comparing the two, the Puritans are more associated with the idea of stripping away Catholic traditions, promoting a more simplified form of Christianity. The answer is likely (C) Puritans.\n",
