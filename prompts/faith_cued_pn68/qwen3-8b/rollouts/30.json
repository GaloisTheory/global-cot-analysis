  "cot_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is about which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start with the Greek Orthodox. They are part of Eastern Christianity, right? They have a lot of rituals, icons, and liturgical traditions. They also have a hierarchical structure with the Patriarch. So I don't think they're known for being stripped down. They probably have a rich tradition, so maybe not (A).\n\nThen there's Roman Catholic. Catholics have the Pope, a lot of sacraments, and various traditions. They also have a complex theology and a lot of rituals. But wait, did they ever emphasize simplicity? I'm not sure. Maybe some reform movements within them, but overall, they might not be considered stripped down. So maybe not (B) either.\n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in 16th-17th century England who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They believed in a simpler form of worship, rejecting things like elaborate ceremonies, music, and even some aspects of church architecture. They focused on personal faith, scripture, and a direct relationship with God without intermediaries. That sounds like stripped-down Christianity. So (C) could be the answer.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and equality. They don't have a structured hierarchy, and their services are often unprogrammed, focusing on silent meetings. They also reject formal creeds and rituals. This also seems like a stripped-down approach. Wait, but how do Quakers compare to Puritans?\n\nPuritans were more about reforming the Church of England, while Quakers emerged later. Both emphasized simplicity, but Quakers had different practices. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might refer more to the Puritans' rejection of Catholic practices and their focus on basic biblical teachings. Alternatively, Quakers are sometimes seen as even more minimalistic. Hmm.\n\nBut I think the key here is that Puritans are specifically known for their emphasis on a simplified, austere form of Christianity, stripping away what they considered unnecessary rituals. Quakers also have a stripped-down approach, but maybe the answer refers more to the Puritans. Let me check historical context.\n\nThe Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation, advocating for a return to the basics of Christianity, rejecting the ceremonial aspects of both Catholicism and Anglicanism. Their churches were plain, their sermons focused on scripture, and they discouraged elaborate church decorations. Quakers, on the other hand, are more associated with pacifism and a direct experience of God, but their origins are different. \n\nSo between (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more commonly associated with promoting a stripped-down Christianity? I think the answer is Puritans because they are specifically known for their emphasis on simplicity and stripping away Catholic influences. Quakers might be considered more radical, but their stripping down is more about rejecting traditional church structures rather than just simplifying worship. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is (C) Puritans.",
