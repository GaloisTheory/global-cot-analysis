  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start with the options. Greek Orthodox is a branch of Eastern Christianity. They have a lot of rituals and traditions, like icons, specific liturgical practices, and a hierarchical structure. So they probably aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach. \n\nRoman Catholicism is another major denomination. They have a lot of sacraments, a centralized authority in the Pope, and various traditions. They also have a rich liturgy and a lot of ceremonies. So maybe not the answer either. \n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Anglican Church in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Roman Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They focused on personal piety, the Bible as the sole authority, and a more straightforward form of Christianity. That sounds like \"stripped-down\" Christianity. \n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, are another denomination. They are known for their emphasis on inner light, simplicity, and direct communion with God. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their services are often unstructured. However, I'm not sure if they are specifically known for a stripped-down approach compared to the Puritans. \n\nWait, the Puritans were more about reforming the Church of England, whereas Quakers were a separate movement that emerged later. The Puritans did advocate for a simpler form of worship, so maybe they are the correct answer. \n\nBut let me double-check. The term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to a more austere or simplified version. The Puritans did reject Catholic practices and wanted a more direct, Bible-based form of worship. Quakers also emphasize simplicity, but maybe the Puritans are more associated with that in the context of denominations. \n\nSo between C and D. The answer is likely C, Puritans.\n",
