  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. I know that Greek Orthodox is one of the oldest Christian denominations, and they have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They emphasize the sacraments and have a rich tradition of iconography and theological teachings. So I don't think they're known for being stripped-down.\n\nNext, the Roman Catholic Church. They are also a major denomination with a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They have a vast array of traditions and practices. So again, not likely to be stripped-down. They might have some more formal aspects compared to others, but I don't think they're considered minimalistic in their approach.\n\nNow, the Puritans. From what I remember, the Puritans were a group within the 16th and 17th century Protestant movement. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They focused on personal piety, the authority of the Bible, and a more direct relationship with God. So this seems like they promoted a stripped-down Christianity, focusing on the essentials of the faith without the extra embellishments.\n\nThen there's the Quakers. Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simplicity in worship. They don't have a formal clergy, and their meetings are often silent, with members speaking when moved by the Spirit. They also emphasize inner light and direct communion with God. However, Quakers are more of a specific movement within Protestantism, and while they do emphasize simplicity, I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity in the same way as the Puritans. But maybe they are?\n\nWait, the question is about which denomination. The Puritans were a specific group, but they were part of the broader Protestant movement. However, the term \"denomination\" might refer to a specific branch. Quakers are a denomination, as are the Puritans (though they might be considered a movement rather than a denomination). However, the Puritans are often associated with the Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches, which are denominations. But perhaps the answer is Puritans because they are known for their emphasis on simplicity and stripping away what they saw as unnecessary practices.\n\nAlternatively, the Quakers are known for simplicity in worship, but maybe the question is looking for the Puritans. Let me think again. The Puritans were a group that wanted to purify the Church of England, so they were against the elaborate rituals and ceremonies of the Catholic Church, which they saw as corrupt. They advocated for a more simplified form of worship, focusing on the Bible and personal faith. This aligns with the idea of stripped-down Christianity. Quakers, while also simple, might be more about spiritual equality and direct experience. \n\nSo between Puritans and Quakers, which is more known for stripped-down Christianity? I think the Puritans are more associated with that. The answer is likely (C) Puritans. The Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic are more elaborate. Quakers are a different tradition, but the Puritans fit better with the idea of stripping down the practices. So the answer should be (C).\n",
