  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is about which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They have a lot of rituals, icons, and liturgical traditions. They're pretty traditional and have a lot of ceremonial aspects. So maybe not the one that's stripped down.\n\nThen there's the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of sacraments, a hierarchical structure, and a lot of traditions. They also have a lot of rituals and practices. So again, not the stripped-down version. \n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in the 16th and 17th centuries who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing on personal piety and the Bible. They believed in a more direct relationship with God, without the need for intermediaries like priests. So they might be the ones promoting a stripped-down Christianity. \n\nQuakers, on the other hand, are another group. They also emphasize simplicity, but they're more known for their emphasis on the inner light and direct communication with God. They don't have a formal clergy, and their services are very simple. However, the question is about which denomination is known for a stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans are often associated with a more Calvinist approach, focusing on predestination and simplicity in worship. Quakers are a different movement, more radical in some ways, but maybe not as focused on stripping down the Church as the Puritans were. \n\nWait, but the Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation. They wanted to purify the Church of England, so they were against the elaborate practices of the Catholic Church. So their version of Christianity would be more stripped down. Quakers, while also simple, were a separate movement. So the answer is likely (C) Puritans.\n",
