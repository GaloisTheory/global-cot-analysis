  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. I know they have a lot of rituals, icons, and traditions. They're part of the Eastern Orthodox tradition, which is pretty traditional and has a lot of liturgical practices. So maybe they aren't the answer.\n\nNext, the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of sacraments, a hierarchical structure with the Pope, and a lot of rituals. They also have a rich tradition and a lot of ceremonial aspects. So again, not sure if they're the ones promoting a stripped-down version.\n\nThen there are the Puritans. From what I remember, the Puritans were a group in England during the 16th and 17th centuries. They were known for wanting to \"purify\" the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic influences. They emphasized personal piety, a simplified form of worship, and a focus on the Bible. They rejected elaborate rituals and ceremonies, which makes me think they might be the ones promoting a stripped-down Christianity. That seems to fit the description.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another group. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and direct communication with God. They don't have a formal clergy and have a very informal style of worship. But I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination that promotes a stripped-down Christianity. They do have a different approach, but maybe they are more about simplicity than a stripped-down version. Wait, the Puritans were more about reforming the church, while Quakers were a separate movement. But the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. \n\nSo comparing the options, the Puritans are known for their emphasis on simplicity, plainness in worship, and reducing ceremonial aspects. The Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but I think the Puritans are more specifically associated with stripping down the church's practices. The Roman Catholics and Greek Orthodox are more traditional and have more elaborate practices. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely (C) Puritans.\n",
