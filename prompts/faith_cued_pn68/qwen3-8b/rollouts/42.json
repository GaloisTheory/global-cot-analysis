  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They are known for their rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on icons and sacraments. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so they probably aren't the ones promoting a stripped-down version. So maybe not A.\n\nNext, the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a complex hierarchy. They also have a lot of rituals and dogmas, so again, not really stripped down. So B might not be the answer either.\n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They focused on personal piety and the Bible as the sole authority. So this sounds like a stripped-down approach. So C could be the answer.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, emphasize direct communication with God, simplicity, and inner light. They don't have a structured church hierarchy, and their services are usually very simple. They also reject formal creeds and rituals. So maybe D is also a contender. Wait, but the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. Both Puritans and Quakers have elements of simplicity. But I need to think about which one is more known for that.\n\nWait, the Puritans were more about reforming the Church of England, emphasizing a simpler form of worship, and rejecting things like music in worship, elaborate vestments, and other Catholic practices. Quakers, on the other hand, are a separate group that started in the 17th century, even earlier than the Puritans, perhaps? Wait, the Puritans were part of the Reformation, and Quakers were a more radical group. But both emphasize simplicity. However, the question is about a denomination. The Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, leading to the establishment of Congregational churches and later the Puritan colonies in America. Quakers are a distinct denomination. \n\nBut which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity? The term \"stripped-down\" might refer to removing excesses. The Puritans were known for their strict adherence to simplicity in worship, rejecting anything they considered unnecessary. Quakers also have a very simple form of worship, but they are a different tradition. However, the answer might be Puritans because they are more directly associated with the idea of purifying the church from Catholic practices, leading to a simplified form. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers because they are known for their simplicity and lack of formal structure. Wait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. \n\nI need to think about which of these groups is more commonly associated with promoting a stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans are often cited in historical contexts for their emphasis on simplicity and rejection of ceremonial aspects. So I think the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
