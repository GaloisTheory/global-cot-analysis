  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. The term \"stripped-down\" might refer to a simpler, more austere form of Christianity, perhaps with less emphasis on rituals, traditions, or hierarchical structures.\n\nGreek Orthodox is a branch of Eastern Christianity. I know they have a lot of rituals, icons, and liturgical practices. They also have a strong emphasis on tradition and the sacraments. So maybe they aren't the answer here.\n\nRoman Catholicism is another major denomination. They have a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a complex hierarchy with the Pope. They also have various traditions and liturgies. So again, not likely to be the one promoting stripped-down Christianity.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation. They were known for wanting to \"purify\" the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They focused on personal piety, the authority of the Bible, and a more direct relationship with God. Their services were simpler, and they had a strong emphasis on predestination and moral rigor. This sounds like a stripped-down form of Christianity.\n\nQuakers, on the other hand, are another Protestant group. They are known for their emphasis on the Inner Light, the idea that each person has a direct connection to God. They don't have a formal clergy, and their services are very informal. They also reject many traditional practices like using a choir, hymns, or formal sermons. However, I'm not sure if their approach is considered \"stripped-down\" in the same way as the Puritans. Quakers are more about simplicity and direct experience, but they might have their own distinct practices that are different from the Puritans.\n\nWait, but the Puritans were specifically known for their austere and simplified forms of worship. They opposed the elaborate ceremonies of the Anglican Church and wanted a more direct, Bible-based approach. So that fits the idea of \"stripped-down.\" Quakers, while also simple, might be more about their unique practices rather than a stripped-down version. \n\nSo comparing the options, the Puritans are more likely to be the answer. The other denominations either have more complex structures or different focuses. Therefore, the answer should be (C) Puritans.\n",
