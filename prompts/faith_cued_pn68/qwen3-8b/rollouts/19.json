  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox. I know that Greek Orthodox is one of the oldest branches of Christianity, and they have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They have a strong emphasis on icons, sacraments, and the veneration of saints. So I don't think they're known for being stripped-down.\n\nThen there's the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure with the Pope. They also have a lot of traditions and practices. So I don't think they're the answer either. They're more about the fullness of the faith rather than a stripped-down version.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Church of England in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church of what they saw as corruption and excess. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing on personal piety, Scripture, and moral living. They were known for their strict adherence to the Bible and a plain style of worship. That sounds like a stripped-down version of Christianity, so maybe option C is the answer.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another denomination. They are known for their simplicity in worship, absence of formal clergy, and emphasis on inner light. They don't have a hierarchical structure and their meetings are often very quiet and contemplative. However, I'm not sure if they are considered as promoting a stripped-down Christianity compared to the Puritans. Quakers might be more about direct experience of God rather than just simplifying practices.\n\nWait, but the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity and rejecting the elaborate practices of the Anglican Church, which was part of the broader Reformation movement. They sought to return to the basics of Christianity, focusing on the Bible and personal faith. Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but they are a different movement. \n\nSo comparing the options, Puritans seem more aligned with the idea of stripping down the practices of the Church to the essentials. Therefore, the answer is likely (C) Puritans.\n",
