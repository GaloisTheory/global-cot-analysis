  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They are known for their rich traditions, liturgical practices, and the use of icons. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down version. \n\nThen there's the Roman Catholic Church. They also have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They might have a lot of rituals and practices, so again, not the stripped-down version. \n\nNext, the Puritans. From what I remember, the Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized a simple, direct form of worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies and focusing on personal faith and scripture. This sounds like a stripped-down approach. \n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They are known for their emphasis on inner light and simplicity. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their meetings are often unstructured. They also tend to have a more plain and simple style of worship. So Quakers might also be a candidate. \n\nWait, but the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were known for their strict adherence to the Bible and minimalistic practices. They rejected things like elaborate church music, stained glass, and other ornate elements. Quakers also have a simple approach, but I think the term \"stripped-down\" might be more associated with the Puritans. \n\nAnother angle: the Puritans were a movement within Protestantism that sought to simplify worship and doctrine, emphasizing the Bible and personal piety. Quakers, while also simple, might be considered a separate denomination. The answer options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. \n\nI need to check which one is more commonly associated with a stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans are often seen as promoting a more austere and simplified version of Christianity compared to the established churches. Quakers have their own distinct practices, but maybe the term \"stripped-down\" is more directly linked to the Puritans. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely (C) Puritans.\n",
