  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start with the Greek Orthodox. I know that Greek Orthodox is a branch of Eastern Christianity. They have a lot of traditions, like icons, liturgical practices, and a hierarchical structure with the Patriarch. They also have a rich tradition of theology and rituals, so I don't think they're known for being stripped down.\n\nNext, Roman Catholicism. The Roman Catholic Church is one of the largest Christian denominations. They have a lot of sacraments, a complex hierarchy with the Pope, and a lot of rituals and traditions. They also have a lot of theological teachings and practices. So, again, not really stripped down. Maybe they have some simplifications in certain regions, but overall, they are not known for minimalism.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in 16th and 17th century England. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary practices and rituals. They emphasized simplicity in worship, a focus on the Bible, and personal piety. They rejected elaborate ceremonies and sought a more direct relationship with God through scripture. That sounds like a stripped-down approach to Christianity, focusing on essentials and rejecting excess. So Puritans might be the answer here.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They are known for their emphasis on inner light, simplicity, and pacifism. They don't have a structured hierarchy, and their meetings are often unprogrammed. They also value direct experience of God and simplicity in their practices. Quakers might also fit the description of stripped-down Christianity, but I need to compare them with Puritans.\n\nWait, the question is about which denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. Both Puritans and Quakers have elements of simplicity. However, the key here is that Puritans were a specific group within the Protestant Reformation that sought to purify the church, while Quakers are a distinct denomination with their own unique practices. \n\nBut considering the options given, the Puritans are more associated with the Reformation and the movement towards a simpler form of worship. Quakers are sometimes considered more radical, but their emphasis on simplicity is part of their identity. However, the answer might be Puritans because the question refers to a denomination, and Puritans are a specific group, while Quakers are a separate denomination. \n\nWait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. I need to check which one is more accurately described as promoting stripped-down Christianity. \n\nPuritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, rejecting the elaborate rituals of the Anglican Church and other denominations. They focused on the Bible, personal piety, and a more austere form of Christianity. Quakers, on the other hand, are known for their simplicity, but they also have a unique structure and practices that might be considered even more stripped down, like not having a formal hierarchy and emphasizing the inner light. \n\nBut the question is about a denomination. Quakers are a denomination, as are Puritans (though Puritans were a movement within the Church of England, but they later formed their own congregations). However, the Puritans are often grouped as a denomination in this context. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers. But I need to verify. \n\nLooking up, Puritans are associated with the Reformation, emphasizing simplicity, and rejecting Catholic practices. Quakers are known for their simplicity, but they also have a different approach. However, the answer might be Puritans because they are known for stripping down the church's practices. \n\nAnother angle: the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to rejecting rituals and focusing on the essentials. Puritans were against the Catholic Church's rituals, so they would be stripping down. Quakers also rejected formal structures, but perhaps the Puritans are more directly associated with this. \n\nTherefore, considering all that, the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
