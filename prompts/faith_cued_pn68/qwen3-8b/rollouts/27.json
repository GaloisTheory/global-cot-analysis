  "cot_content": "\nOkay, so the question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. Let me think through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized a simplified form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing more on personal faith and scripture. That sounds like \"stripped-down\" Christianity. \n\nNow, the Greek Orthodox Church is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, and elaborate ceremonies. They have a lot of sacraments and rituals, so they probably aren't the answer. Roman Catholicism also has a lot of traditions, sacraments, and hierarchical structures. They might not be considered stripped down either. \n\nQuakers, on the other hand, are known for their simplicity in worship. They don't have a clergy, and their meetings are often silent with no formal prayers or sermons. They emphasize direct communication with God and inner light. That also fits the idea of stripped-down Christianity. Wait, so both Puritans and Quakers might fit? But the options are single choice. \n\nWait, the question says \"stripped-down Christianity.\" The Puritans were more about reforming the Church of England, and their approach was more about simplifying worship and doctrine, but they still had a structured church. Quakers took it even further, rejecting formal church structures and rituals. So maybe both could be considered, but which one is more known for that? \n\nI remember that the Puritans are often associated with the idea of a \"simple\" or \"stripped-down\" faith, especially in the context of the Reformation. They were against the elaborate rituals of the Catholic Church and wanted a more direct approach to Christianity. Quakers also have that simplicity, but maybe the term \"stripped-down\" is more commonly linked to the Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers because they are even more minimalistic. But I need to verify. Let me think: the Puritans were part of the Protestant movement, emphasizing simplicity in worship and rejecting Catholic practices. Quakers are a separate group, founded in the 17th century, with even simpler practices. \n\nBut the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. Both could be candidates, but perhaps the answer expected here is Puritans. However, I'm a bit confused because I've heard Quakers also being described as having a stripped-down approach. \n\nWait, the original answer given by the Stanford professor is (C) Puritans. So maybe that's the intended answer. But I need to make sure. Let me think again. The Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, not a denomination in the same sense as the Quakers. Quakers are a distinct denomination. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers because they are known for their simple, plain style of worship. But I'm not sure. Let me check my memory. In the context of the question, the answer is likely Puritans because they are often cited as promoting a stripped-down, simplified form of Christianity. Quakers might be more associated with other aspects, like pacifism or egalitarianism. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
