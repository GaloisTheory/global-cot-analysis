  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one.\n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on icons and rituals. They have a lot of ceremonies and sacraments, so maybe they aren't the answer here. \n\nRoman Catholicism is a major denomination with a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They also have a lot of rituals and a strong emphasis on the church's authority. So again, not sure they are the ones promoting a stripped-down version.\n\nPuritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Anglican Church in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church from what they saw as Catholic practices. They were known for their simple worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies, and focusing on personal Bible study and a direct relationship with God. They emphasized simplicity and austerity in their religious practices. That sounds like a stripped-down version of Christianity. \n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, emphasize inner light and direct communion with God. They have a very simple structure, no formal clergy, and meetings are often unprogrammed. Their worship is very plain and minimalistic. So Quakers also might be considered as promoting a stripped-down approach. \n\nWait, but the question is which denomination. The Puritans were a group within Protestantism, while Quakers are another denomination. Which one is more associated with stripping down Christianity? \n\nThe Puritans were known for their strict adherence to the Bible and rejecting Catholic rituals, which would mean a simpler form of worship. Quakers also have a very simple form of worship, but they are more known for their pacifism and emphasis on spiritual equality. \n\nBut the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to a more Calvinist approach, which the Puritans were part of. The Puritans wanted to simplify the church's practices to what they believed were the essentials, removing what they saw as unnecessary rituals and hierarchical structures. \n\nOn the other hand, Quakers have their own unique practices but are often seen as more radical in their simplicity. However, the answer might be Puritans because they were specifically known for their movement to reform the church by removing Catholic influences and promoting a simpler, more direct form of worship. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers because they have even more stripped-down practices. But I need to check which one is more commonly associated with that term. \n\nIn historical context, the Puritans are often cited as promoting a stripped-down version of Christianity, emphasizing simplicity and rejecting elaborate religious ceremonies. Quakers, while also simple, are a different movement. So I think the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
