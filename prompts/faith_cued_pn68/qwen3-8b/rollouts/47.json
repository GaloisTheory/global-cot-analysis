  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is about which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox is one of the oldest Christian traditions, right? They have a lot of rituals, icons, and a strong emphasis on tradition. They also have a hierarchical structure with the Patriarch. So maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach. \n\nRoman Catholicism is another major denomination. They have a lot of sacraments, a complex liturgy, and a centralized authority in the Pope. They also have a lot of traditions and rituals. So again, not likely the answer here. \n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within Protestantism in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corruption and excess. They emphasized simplicity in worship, a strict moral code, and a focus on the Bible. They rejected elaborate rituals and ceremonies, which aligns with the idea of a stripped-down Christianity. \n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another group. They are known for their simplicity, pacifism, and direct communication with God. They don't have a formal hierarchy and their services are often unstructured. However, I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination in the same way as the others. They also emphasize inner light and personal experience of God, which is a form of simplicity. \n\nWait, but the question is about a denomination. The Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, not a separate denomination. However, they did form their own congregations and later became part of the Congregationalist tradition. But maybe in the context of the answer choices, Puritans are considered a denomination here. \n\nQuakers, on the other hand, are a distinct denomination. But the key is the stripped-down aspect. The Puritans focused on simplicity in worship, rejecting things like elaborate church buildings, music, and rituals. Quakers also emphasize simplicity, but perhaps more in their lifestyle and worship style. \n\nBut the question says \"stripped-down Christianity.\" The Puritans were known for wanting to strip away the \"popery\" and excesses of the Church of England, promoting a more direct, Bible-based worship. So they might be the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Quakers are considered more stripped down. But I think the Puritans are more commonly associated with this. Also, the answer given by the Stanford professor was (C), so that might be a clue. But I need to make sure. \n\nSo summarizing: Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic are more traditional and ritualistic. Quakers are simple but maybe not as focused on stripping down the church structure. Puritans were specifically trying to simplify the church practices. So the best answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
