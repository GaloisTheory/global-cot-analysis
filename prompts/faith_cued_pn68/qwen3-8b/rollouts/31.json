  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this question. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. I know that Greek Orthodox is one of the oldest Christian denominations, and they have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They emphasize sacraments like baptism, communion, and the veneration of saints. They also have a strong emphasis on icons and theological traditions. So maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nNext, Roman Catholicism. The Roman Catholic Church is also a major denomination with a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They have a papal authority, a vast number of rituals, and a lot of dogmatic teachings. They definitely don't seem stripped down. So probably not option B.\n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in 16th to 17th century England who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They believed in a simplified form of worship, emphasizing the Bible and personal piety over elaborate rituals. They rejected things like church music, elaborate vestments, and other ceremonial aspects. So they were known for a more austere, stripped-down form of Christianity. That makes me think option C might be the answer.\n\nQuakers, which is option D. Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simplicity, pacifism, and emphasis on the Inner Light. They don't have a formal clergy, and their services are very informal, often involving silent meetings and direct communication with God. They also emphasize social justice and equality. But I'm not sure if they are considered as promoting a stripped-down Christianity as much as the Puritans. The Puritans were more focused on reforming the Church of England, while Quakers were a separate movement that started later and had different practices. \n\nWait, but the question says \"stripped-down Christianity.\" The Puritans were definitely known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship and doctrine, rejecting the ceremonial aspects of the Church of England. They wanted a more direct, personal relationship with God based on the Bible. That seems like a stripped-down version. Quakers also have simplicity, but maybe their approach is more about direct experience and less about the structure of the church. \n\nAnother angle: the Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation, which was about reforming the Church, but they were more radical than the Reformers like Luther or Calvin. They wanted to remove all traces of Catholicism from the Church of England. Their approach was to simplify worship, focus on preaching, and personal Bible study. So their Christianity was stripped of the elaborate rituals and hierarchical structures. \n\nGreek Orthodox and Roman Catholic are both more traditional and have complex rituals, so they're not the answer. Quakers are also a bit different, but maybe the Puritans fit better. So the answer is C, Puritans.\n",
