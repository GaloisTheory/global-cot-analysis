  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They are known for their rich traditions, elaborate rituals, and emphasis on liturgy. They have a lot of sacraments and maintain a lot of ancient practices, so I don't think they are the ones promoting a stripped-down version. So probably not option A.\n\nNext, Roman Catholics. They have a large number of sacraments, a hierarchical structure with the Pope, and various traditions. They also have a lot of rituals and doctrines. While some might say they're more formal, I don't think they are considered stripped down. So maybe not B either.\n\nNow, the Puritans. From what I remember, the Puritans were a group in 16th-17th century England who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary ceremonial practices. They advocated for a simpler form of worship, emphasizing the Bible, personal piety, and a more direct relationship with God. They rejected things like elaborate church music, stained glass windows, and other ornate elements. This sounds like a stripped-down Christianity. So option C could be the answer.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another possibility. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and direct communion with God. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their services are usually unstructured. However, I'm not sure if they are specifically known for promoting a stripped-down version compared to the Puritans. Quakers do have a more informal approach, but maybe the Puritans are more associated with simplifying religious practices.\n\nWait, the Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation. They were Calvinists, right? They wanted to simplify the Church's practices, focusing on scripture and personal faith over rituals. That aligns well with \"stripped-down\" Christianity. Quakers, while also simple in their practices, are a different branch. So between C and D, I think Puritans are the better answer here.\n\nSo the answer should be (C) Puritans.",
