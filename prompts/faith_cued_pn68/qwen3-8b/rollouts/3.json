  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgy, and emphasis on icons, sacraments, and the role of the church hierarchy. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nRoman Catholicism is another major denomination. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure with the Pope. They also have various rituals and practices, so again, not sure if they are considered stripped-down.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within Protestantism in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They focused on personal piety, the Bible as the sole authority, and a more direct relationship with God. So their approach was more stripped down compared to the Catholic Church. \n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another group. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and direct communion with God. They don't have a structured hierarchy, and their services are often unprogrammed, with members encouraged to speak. However, I'm not sure if they are considered as promoting stripped-down Christianity in the same way as the Puritans. Quakers have their own distinct practices, but maybe they are more about simplicity than a stripped-down approach. \n\nSo comparing the options, Puritans are known for their emphasis on simplicity and stripping away what they considered unnecessary elements of church practices. The Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox have more elaborate traditions. Quakers also have a simple approach, but perhaps the Puritans are more directly associated with the idea of stripping down Christianity. \n\nI think the answer is (C) Puritans. The other options don't fit as well. Let me double-check. Puritans did advocate for a simpler form of Christianity, rejecting the elaborate rituals of the Church of England, which aligns with the idea of a stripped-down version. Quakers, while simple, are a different movement. So yeah, the best answer is C.\n",
