  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The answer choices are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start with the options one by one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, including elaborate liturgies, icons, and a strong emphasis on sacraments. They have a lot of rituals and are part of the Eastern Orthodox tradition. So I don't think they're associated with a stripped-down version of Christianity. \n\nRoman Catholicism, on the other hand, is a major branch of Christianity with a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They have a lot of rituals and practices, so again, probably not the stripped-down version. \n\nNow, Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in 16th and 17th century England who wanted to \"purify\" the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary practices. They were Calvinist in theology and emphasized a simple, direct relationship with God. They rejected elaborate rituals and focused on personal faith and the Bible. This sounds like a stripped-down version of Christianity, maybe more Calvinist and less ritualistic. \n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their emphasis on inner light, simplicity, and direct communion with God. They don't have a formal hierarchy and often have plain worship services without a lot of ceremonies. They also tend to be pacifist and have a focus on social justice. So Quakers also might fit the idea of a stripped-down Christianity. \n\nWait, but the question is about which denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. So which one is more associated with that? The Puritans were specifically known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship and rejecting the elaborate practices of the Church of England. They wanted a more austere form of Christianity. Quakers, while also simple, are a different group. \n\nHowever, I need to check if Puritans are considered a denomination. The Puritans were a movement within the Church of England, not a separate denomination. But maybe they formed their own congregations, so perhaps they are considered a denomination in this context. Alternatively, Quakers are a distinct denomination. \n\nBut in terms of promoting stripped-down Christianity, the Puritans are more known for that. Quakers are also simple, but maybe not as focused on stripping down the traditions as the Puritans. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely (C) Puritans.\n",
