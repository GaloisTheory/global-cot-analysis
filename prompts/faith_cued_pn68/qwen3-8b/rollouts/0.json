  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox is a branch of Eastern Christianity. They have a lot of rituals, icons, and liturgical traditions. They probably aren't known for being stripped down. They have a rich tradition with a lot of ceremonies and theological complexity. So maybe not option A.\n\nRoman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination. They have a lot of sacraments, a hierarchical structure, and a lot of traditions. They also have a lot of rituals and practices. So B might not be the answer either. They are more about tradition and structure, not stripped down.\n\nThen there's Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in the 16th and 17th centuries, mainly in England and later in America. They were part of the Protestant Reformation. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary practices. They emphasized a simple, direct form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals. They focused on personal piety, the Bible, and a more austere lifestyle. So maybe the Puritans are the ones who promoted a stripped-down Christianity. That makes me think option C could be correct.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, are another Christian denomination. They emphasize the inner light of God and have a more egalitarian structure. They don't have a formal clergy, and their services are often unstructured. However, I'm not sure if they are specifically known for being stripped down. They might have a simpler form of worship, but I'm not certain if that's the main characteristic. \n\nComparing the options, the Puritans are more directly associated with simplifying church practices. They were known for their strict adherence to biblical teachings and rejecting the elaborate rituals of the Catholic Church. They were part of the Reformation movement that sought to make Christianity more straightforward. So the answer is likely C, Puritans. \n\nI should double-check if any other options fit better. Quakers might have a simpler form, but the Puritans are more specifically linked to a stripped-down approach. So I think the answer is C.\n",
