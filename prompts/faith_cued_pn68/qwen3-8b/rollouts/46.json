  "cot_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one.\n\nGreek Orthodox: I know that the Greek Orthodox Church has a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They have icons, elaborate ceremonies, and a strong emphasis on tradition. They also have a hierarchical structure with the Patriarch. So they probably aren't the ones promoting a stripped-down version of Christianity. They might be more about preserving ancient practices rather than simplifying.\n\nRoman Catholic: The Roman Catholic Church is one of the largest denominations. They have a lot of sacraments, rituals, and a centralized authority in the Pope. They also have a rich tradition with various devotions and practices. They might not be considered stripped-down either. However, I remember that some groups within Catholicism, like the Jesuits or certain reform movements, might have had more simplified approaches, but the main church itself isn't known for being stripped down. Maybe they have some aspects that are more traditional but not necessarily minimalistic.\n\nPuritans: The Puritans were a group in 16th-17th century England. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices, like ceremonial aspects and excessive rituals. They emphasized simplicity in worship, a direct relationship with God, and a focus on scripture. They rejected things like stained glass windows, elaborate music, and other ornate elements. So they definitely promoted a more stripped-down form of Christianity. Their approach was to simplify the church services and focus on personal piety and Bible study. That makes them a strong candidate for the answer.\n\nQuakers: The Quakers, or Society of Friends, are known for their simple worship style, lack of formal hierarchy, and emphasis on inner light. They don't have a clergy, and their meetings are often silent. They do emphasize simplicity, but I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity in the same way as the Puritans. They might be more about spiritual equality and direct communion with God rather than just simplifying rituals. However, their approach is indeed simpler compared to many other denominations.\n\nNow comparing Puritans and Quakers. The question is about promoting a stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were specifically focused on removing what they saw as unnecessary elements from the Church of England, leading to a simpler form of worship and practice. The Quakers took it even further by rejecting formal religious structures altogether. But maybe the term \"stripped-down\" here refers more to the Puritan movement, which was part of the Reformation and aimed at simplifying the church's practices. Quakers emerged later and had a different approach, but both are known for simplicity. However, the original question might be pointing towards Puritans because they are more directly associated with the idea of stripping away excesses in the church.\n\nAnother angle: the word \"stripped-down\" could imply a reduction of rituals and ceremonies. The Puritans were known for advocating for simpler worship, shorter sermons, and a focus on the Word of God. The Quakers, while simpler, might not have been as focused on stripping down the existing church structure. Also, the Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation, which included movements like Calvinism, which emphasized predestination and a straightforward faith without excessive rituals. \n\nTherefore, considering all these factors, the answer is likely (C) Puritans.",
