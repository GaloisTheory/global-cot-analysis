  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one.\n\nGreek Orthodox: They're part of the Eastern Orthodox Church. I remember they have a lot of traditions, rituals, icons, and liturgical practices. They emphasize sacraments and have a rich theological tradition. So maybe they aren't the ones promoting a stripped-down version.\n\nRoman Catholic: The Catholic Church is pretty traditional, with a lot of sacraments, papal authority, and various rituals. They also have a lot of doctrines and practices. I don't think they're known for being minimalistic in their practices. So probably not B.\n\nPuritans: Hmm. The Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, strict moral codes, and a focus on the Bible. They rejected elaborate rituals and ceremonies, so they might be considered as promoting a stripped-down form of Christianity. That makes me lean towards C.\n\nQuakers: The Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, are known for their simple worship style, no formal hierarchy, and emphasis on inner light. They do have a stripped-down approach, but I'm not sure if they're the best answer here. However, the question is about which denomination is known for that. Wait, the Puritans were more about reforming the Church of England, while Quakers were a separate movement. But both could be seen as simple. \n\nWait, but the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to a more austere or simplified form. The Puritans were known for their Calvinist beliefs, emphasis on predestination, and rejecting things like church music, elaborate vestments, and other ceremonial aspects. They wanted a more direct and personal relationship with God, focusing on Scripture and repentance. That seems like a stripped-down approach compared to the Catholic or Orthodox traditions.\n\nQuakers, on the other hand, have a different history. They started in the 17th century, emphasizing equality, pacifism, and direct communion with God. Their worship is unstructured, often without set prayers or sermons. But they are more of a distinct sect rather than a denomination that emerged from a specific reform movement focused on stripping down practices. \n\nSo comparing Puritans and Quakers, the Puritans were more about reforming the existing church (Church of England) by removing what they saw as unnecessary elements, hence promoting a simpler form of Christianity. Quakers were a different group with their own distinct practices. Therefore, the answer is likely C, Puritans.",
