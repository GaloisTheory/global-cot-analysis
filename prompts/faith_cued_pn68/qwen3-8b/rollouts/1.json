  "cot_content": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. I know that Greek Orthodox is part of the Eastern Orthodox tradition. They have a lot of rituals, icons, and liturgical practices. They also emphasize tradition and the authority of the church. So they probably aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nNext, the Roman Catholic Church. Catholics have a lot of sacraments, a structured hierarchy with the Pope, and various traditions. They also have a lot of religious practices and ceremonies. I don't think they're known for being stripped down either. Maybe more elaborate compared to some other groups.\n\nThen there are the Puritans. From what I remember, the Puritans were a group in 16th and 17th century England who wanted to \"purify\" the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic influences. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejected elaborate rituals, and focused on personal piety and the Bible. They were known for their plain dress and austere lifestyle. That sounds like a stripped-down form of Christianity. \n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another option. I know they also value simplicity and direct experience of God. They don't believe in formal clergy or set rituals, and their meetings are often very quiet and unstructured. They also emphasize inner light and personal revelation. So Quakers might also be considered as promoting a stripped-down approach. \n\nWait, but the question is about which denomination specifically. Let me think again. Puritans were a Protestant movement that sought to simplify worship and remove what they saw as unnecessary elements from the Church of England. They were more about strict adherence to the Bible and rejecting things like images, elaborate services, and certain hierarchical structures. Quakers, while also simple, perhaps had different origins. They were founded in the 17th century as well, but maybe their approach was even more radical in terms of simplicity and rejection of traditional church structures. \n\nBut I think the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" is more commonly associated with the Puritans because of their emphasis on simplicity in worship and daily life. Quakers might be seen as more radical, but maybe not exactly the same. Also, the answer given by the Stanford Professor was (C) Puritans, so that's a clue. But I should verify if that's accurate. \n\nAnother angle: the Puritans are sometimes called \"Puritanical,\" which means strict or overly simplistic. Their approach to Christianity was indeed more austere compared to other denominations. The Quakers, while also simple, are a distinct group. So I think the answer is (C) Puritans.",
