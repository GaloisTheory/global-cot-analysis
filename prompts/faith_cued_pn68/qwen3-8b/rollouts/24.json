  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox is a branch of Eastern Christianity. They have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They value icons, sacraments, and a rich theological tradition. So I don't think they're known for being stripped-down. They might have a lot of ceremonies and practices, so maybe not (A).\n\nRoman Catholicism is another major denomination. They have a lot of sacraments, a structured hierarchy with the Pope, and various rituals. They also have a lot of traditions and teachings. So (B) might not be the answer either since they're not stripped down.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Church of England in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church from what they saw as corruption and excesses, especially Catholic practices. They advocated for a simpler form of worship, emphasizing the Bible, personal piety, and a more direct relationship with God. They opposed elaborate rituals and hierarchical structures. This sounds like a stripped-down version of Christianity, focusing on basics like scripture and personal faith. So (C) Puritans could be the answer.\n\nQuakers, on the other hand, are another denomination. They emphasize direct communication with God, simplicity, and inner light. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their services are often unstructured. But I'm not sure if they are considered as promoting a stripped-down Christianity compared to the Puritans. Quakers might be more focused on spiritual experience rather than simplicity in practice. However, both Puritans and Quakers have elements of simplicity. Wait, but the Puritans were more about reforming the church and simplifying worship practices, while Quakers might have a different approach. \n\nLet me think again. The term \"stripped-down\" could refer to minimalism in rituals, emphasis on personal faith over institutional practices. The Puritans were known for their strict adherence to the Bible and rejecting Catholic practices like elaborate ceremonies, music, and decorations in churches. They wanted a more austere and direct form of worship. Quakers, while also simple, might have a different focus. For example, Quakers don't have clergy, and their meetings are more about silent worship. But the question is about which denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. \n\nSo, considering the options, the Puritans are more associated with stripping away Catholic traditions and simplifying the church's practices. The answer is likely (C) Puritans. The other options don't fit as well. The Quakers might be close, but I think the Puritans are more directly associated with this concept.\n",
