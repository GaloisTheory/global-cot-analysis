  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They are known for their rich traditions, liturgical practices, and use of icons. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nThen there's the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of sacraments, rituals, and a hierarchical structure. They also have a lot of traditions and practices, so again, not necessarily stripped-down. They might be more elaborate than some other denominations.\n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in England during the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity, a plain style of worship, and a focus on personal faith and scripture. They rejected elaborate rituals and church decorations, so maybe they are the ones promoting a stripped-down Christianity.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their emphasis on inner light and simplicity. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their services are often unstructured. They also value plainness in dress and speech. So Quakers might also be considered as promoting simplicity. But I need to compare them with the Puritans.\n\nWait, the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were a movement within Protestantism that sought to simplify worship and remove what they saw as unnecessary elements from the Church of England. They were known for their plain dress, simple worship, and emphasis on personal piety. Quakers also emphasize simplicity, but they are a different denomination. \n\nSo between Puritans and Quakers. Which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity? The Puritans were more focused on reforming the church, removing Catholic practices, while Quakers were a separate movement that rejected many traditional practices. However, the Puritans are often associated with the idea of a more austere, simplified form of Christianity. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. The correct answer is likely (C) Puritans. The Quakers are also simple, but maybe the Puritans are more directly associated with the stripped-down aspect. \n\nSo the answer should be (C) Puritans.\n",
