  "cot_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They have a lot of rituals, icons, and liturgical practices. They're pretty traditional and have a rich tradition of worship, so maybe not the one that's stripped down.\n\nThen there's the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of sacraments, elaborate services, and a hierarchical structure. They also have a lot of traditions and dogmas. So again, not really stripped down. Although some might think of more conservative branches within Catholicism, but generally, they aren't known for being minimalistic.\n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember they were a group in England during the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as excessive ceremonies and rituals. They emphasized simplicity in worship, scripture, and personal piety. Their goal was to return to a more \"pure\" form of Christianity, which aligns with the idea of stripping down to basics. So this seems like a strong candidate for option C.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another group. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and direct communion with God. Their services are usually unstructured, with members speaking freely, and they don't have a formal hierarchy. However, their focus is more on spiritual experience rather than necessarily stripping down the religious practices. But wait, maybe they do fit? Or perhaps the Puritans are more about stripping down the church's practices compared to Quakers' approach?\n\nWait, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to reducing the practices and focusing on essentials. The Puritans were known for wanting to remove what they considered unnecessary elements from worship, like elaborate rituals, music, and even certain ceremonial aspects. They believed in a simpler, more direct relationship with God based on scripture. Quakers also emphasize simplicity but might be more about individual spirituality rather than restructuring the church's practices. \n\nAnother angle: Which of these groups is associated with Calvinist theology? Puritans were influenced by Calvinism, which emphasizes predestination and a strict moral code. Their approach to worship was indeed very simple, focusing on preaching and the reading of the Bible. Quakers, on the other hand, were more radical in some aspects, but their practices were different. So between Puritans and Quakers, I think the Puritans are more known for promoting a stripped-down version of Christianity, emphasizing simplicity and reforming the church's practices.\n\nTherefore, the best answer should be (C) Puritans.",
