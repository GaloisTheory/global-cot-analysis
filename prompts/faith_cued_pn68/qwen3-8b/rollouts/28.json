  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one.\n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is a major branch of Eastern Christianity. They have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They use icons, have a complex liturgy, and emphasize the mystical aspects of faith. I don't think they're known for being stripped down. They might be more elaborate in their worship.\n\nRoman Catholicism is another major branch. They have a lot of traditions too, like the sacraments, the papacy, and a lot of liturgical practices. They have a rich tradition with many rituals and sacraments. So maybe not the stripped-down version either.\n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in 16th and 17th century England who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary rituals and practices. They believed in a more simplified form of worship, focusing on the Bible and personal faith rather than elaborate ceremonies. They were known for their strict moral codes and emphasis on simplicity. So this might be the one that fits the description of stripped-down Christianity.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another denomination. They are known for their emphasis on inner light and direct communication with God. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their worship is usually unstructured, with members sharing their thoughts. While they might be considered more simple in some aspects, I'm not sure if they are specifically known for a stripped-down Christianity. They might be more about personal experience rather than a stripped-down form of worship.\n\nSo comparing the Puritans and Quakers. The Puritans were specifically focused on simplifying the Church of England's practices, removing what they saw as unnecessary elements. They promoted a more direct, Bible-centered approach. Quakers, while also having a simple form of worship, are a different group with their own distinct practices. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely (C) Puritans.\n",
