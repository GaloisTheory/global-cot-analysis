  "cot_content": "\nOkay, so the question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. Let me think through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the Puritans were a group within the Protestant movement in England. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing more on the Bible and personal faith. That sounds like a stripped-down approach. So maybe (C) is the answer.\n\nGreek Orthodox, on the other hand, is part of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which has a rich liturgical tradition. They have a lot of sacraments and rituals, so they probably aren't the ones promoting simplicity. So (A) might not be correct.\n\nRoman Catholicism has a lot of traditions, sacraments, and rituals as well. Even though there's a variety of practices, the overall structure is quite elaborate. So (B) seems unlikely.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simple worship practices. They don't have a structured liturgy, and their meetings are often silent, emphasizing direct communion with God. This also fits the idea of stripped-down Christianity. Wait, so both Puritans and Quakers might be candidates?\n\nBut I need to remember the historical context. The Puritans were more about reforming the Church of England, while Quakers emerged later and were more radical in their approach. The question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans are often associated with a more austere worship style, rejecting things like music in worship, elaborate vestments, and other Catholic influences. Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but they are a separate denomination. However, the question might be looking for the most accurate answer based on common knowledge. \n\nIn history, the Puritans are often cited as advocating for a simpler form of Christianity, emphasizing the Bible and personal responsibility, and rejecting the hierarchical structures and rituals of the Church of England. Quakers are also known for simplicity, but they are a different group. So between C and D. \n\nWait, but the answer choices are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which is more correct? The question says \"denomination,\" and Quakers are a denomination, as are Puritans (though they were a movement within Protestantism). However, the Puritans themselves were not a single denomination but a movement that led to the establishment of Congregationalist churches. But in the context of the options given, it's more likely that the intended answer is (C) Puritans, as they are more commonly associated with stripping down the church's practices. Quakers are also simple, but perhaps less known for that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. But I need to recall. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity, which is why they were called Puritans. They wanted to purify the church of its \"puri\" (i.e., excessive or corrupt) practices. So their approach was to strip away the excesses. Quakers, on the other hand, rejected formal religious structures and had a more egalitarian approach. But in terms of the question, which is about promoting a stripped-down Christianity, both could be considered. However, the answer is likely (C) Puritans. Let me check. \n\nAnother angle: the Quakers are known for their simple, unstructured worship, but they were more radical in their approach. The Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation and focused on simplifying the Church's practices. So the answer is probably (C) Puritans. Therefore, the best answer is (C).\n",
