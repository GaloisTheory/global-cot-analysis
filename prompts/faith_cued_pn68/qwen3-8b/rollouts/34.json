  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox. I know that Greek Orthodox is a branch of Eastern Christianity. They have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They emphasize the sacraments and the role of the Church in preserving tradition. So maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nNext, the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They're known for their rich traditions and the papacy. So again, not really stripped down. They have a lot of ceremonies and practices, so probably not the answer.\n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corruption and excessive rituals. They advocated for a simpler form of worship, focusing on the Bible and personal faith. They rejected things like elaborate church ceremonies and emphasized a more austere, simplified Christianity. That sounds like \"stripped-down.\"\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, are another Protestant denomination. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and direct communion with God. They don't have a formal clergy, and their meetings are often unstructured. But I'm not sure if they are considered as promoting a stripped-down Christianity compared to the Puritans. Quakers might be more about simplicity in their practices, but the Puritans are specifically known for their reformist approach to reduce rituals and focus on the essentials of faith.\n\nSo comparing the options, the Puritans are more associated with stripping away the excesses of the Church, promoting a more simplified and direct form of Christianity. The Quakers also have elements of simplicity, but the question is about a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity, and the Puritans are more directly linked to that movement. Therefore, the answer is C) Puritans.\n",
