  "cot_content": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations believes and practices. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They are known for their rich liturgical traditions, elaborate rituals, and emphasis on icons and sacraments. They have a lot of ceremonies and rituals, so maybe they aren't the ones promoting a stripped-down version. \n\nNext, the Roman Catholic Church. They also have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. There's the papacy, various sacraments like confession, and a lot of rituals. So again, not sure if they are considered stripped-down. Maybe some reform movements within Catholicism, but the main church itself isn't known for being minimalistic.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in 16th and 17th century England who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They believed in simplifying worship, emphasizing personal faith, and rejecting elaborate ceremonies. Their churches were more plain, and they focused on scripture reading and preaching. That sounds like a stripped-down approach compared to the more ceremonial traditions of other denominations. \n\nThen there are the Quakers. I think Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simple worship style without formal clergy, no set services, and an emphasis on inner light. They don't have a structured hierarchy or traditional liturgy. But I'm not sure if they are considered more stripped-down than the Puritans. Quakers might be even simpler, but maybe the question is about which one is specifically known for that. \n\nWait, the question says \"stripped-down Christianity.\" The Puritans were definitely part of the Protestant Reformation and sought to simplify church practices. They rejected things like elaborate music, vestments, and rituals. Their focus was on a direct relationship with God through scripture, which aligns with a more stripped-down approach. Quakers also have a very simple form of worship, but perhaps the term \"stripped-down\" is more commonly associated with the Puritans. \n\nSo comparing the options, Puritans (C) seem to fit better. The answer is likely (C).",
