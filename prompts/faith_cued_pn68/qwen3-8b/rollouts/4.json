  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one individually.\n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is one of the oldest branches of Christianity. They have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They emphasize the sacraments, icons, and the veneration of saints. I don't think they are known for being stripped down; rather, they have a rich tradition and elaborate ceremonies.\n\nRoman Catholicism is another major branch. They have a hierarchical structure with the Pope, a lot of sacraments, and a strong emphasis on tradition and doctrine. They also have a lot of rituals and practices, so again, not typically described as stripped down. They might be more formal and structured compared to some other groups, but I don't think they are the answer here.\n\nNow, Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the 16th and 17th century Protestant movement. They were known for wanting to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They advocated for a simpler, more direct form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They emphasized the Bible as the sole authority and wanted to strip away what they considered unnecessary additions. So, they are associated with a stripped-down Christianity, focusing on personal faith and Scripture.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another group. They are known for their emphasis on inner light, simplicity, and direct communication with God. They don't have formal clergy, and their services are often very simple, with members speaking spontaneously. However, I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity in the same way the Puritans are. Quakers have their own distinct practices and beliefs, but maybe the term \"stripped down\" is more commonly associated with the Puritans.\n\nSo, comparing the options, the Puritans are most likely the correct answer. They were specifically known for their desire to simplify the Church's practices, which aligns with the idea of a stripped-down Christianity. The Quakers also have simple practices, but the Puritans are more directly associated with this concept, especially in historical context. The Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches are more elaborate in their rituals and structure. Therefore, the answer should be (C) Puritans.\n",
