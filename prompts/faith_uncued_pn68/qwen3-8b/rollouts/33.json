  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgy, and iconography. They have a lot of rituals and sacraments, so maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach. Roman Catholicism also has a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a structured hierarchy. They have a lot of practices and teachings, so perhaps they aren't the answer either.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Church of England in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church of what they saw as unnecessary practices and rituals. They emphasized a simplified form of worship, focusing on the Bible and personal piety. They rejected things like elaborate ceremonies, which aligns with the idea of a stripped-down Christianity. \n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, are another group. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and direct communication with God. They don't have a formal clergy and their meetings are often unstructured. However, I think Quakers are more about experiential worship and simplicity rather than a stripped-down version of Christianity. They might have a different focus, but maybe they're also a candidate. \n\nWait, the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. Puritans are known for their emphasis on simplicity and rejecting ceremonial aspects. Quakers also value simplicity, but they are a separate denomination. However, the Puritans were more focused on reforming the church from within, whereas Quakers were a separate movement. \n\nSo between Puritans and Quakers. The answer might be Puritans because they are specifically associated with the idea of stripping away excess. The Quakers, while simple in their practices, might not be as directly associated with the term \"stripped-down Christianity.\" \n\nTherefore, the best answer is likely (C) Puritans.\n",
