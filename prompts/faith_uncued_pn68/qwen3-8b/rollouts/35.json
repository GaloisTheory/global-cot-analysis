  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They have a lot of ceremonial aspects, icons, and specific sacraments. So maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nRoman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a structured hierarchy. They also have a lot of rituals and liturgies, so again, maybe not the stripped-down version. Although there are some reform movements within Catholicism, the denomination itself is more traditional.\n\nPuritans. Hmm, I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Church of England in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church of what they saw as corrupt practices, such as elaborate rituals and hierarchical structures. They emphasized simplicity in worship, a direct relationship with God, and a focus on the Bible. So they promoted a more stripped-down form of Christianity, rejecting the ornate practices of the Anglican Church and the Catholic Church. That sounds like a fit for the question.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends. They are known for their simplicity in worship, speaking in unison, and emphasizing inner light. They also have a very plain style of dress and minimal rituals. Quakers might also fit the description of stripped-down Christianity. But wait, how do they compare to the Puritans?\n\nWait, the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were a movement that sought to simplify the Church's practices, while Quakers were a separate movement that emerged later, in the 17th century. Both emphasize simplicity, but the Puritans were more focused on reforming the Church of England, whereas Quakers were a distinct group that rejected traditional church structures entirely. \n\nBut the question is about a denomination. The Puritans themselves were not a separate denomination but a movement within Anglicanism. However, some Puritan groups did form independent congregations. Quakers, on the other hand, are a recognized denomination. \n\nBut the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to a more austere or simplified form. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity, but so were the Quakers. However, the Quakers were even more radical in their approach, rejecting formal worship and hierarchy. \n\nWait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. The question is which one promotes a stripped-down Christianity. I think the Puritans are more associated with the stripped-down approach, but Quakers also. However, the Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation, while Quakers were a later movement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is the Puritans because they are more directly associated with the idea of stripping away unnecessary practices. The Quakers also have a stripped-down approach, but perhaps the question is looking for the Puritans. \n\nWait, I should check. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on a plain and simple form of worship, rejecting the elaborate rituals of the Anglican Church. They believed in a direct relationship with God through the Bible, and they were against the hierarchical structures of the Church. Quakers, on the other hand, had even more radical practices, like not having a clergy, and emphasizing the inner light. \n\nBut the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more aligned with the Puritans. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers. \n\nWait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more commonly associated with stripped-down Christianity? I think the Puritans are more often cited in that context. For example, the Pilgrims and Puritans were known for their plain living and simple worship. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused because Quakers also have a stripped-down approach. However, the answer might be (C) Puritans. Alternatively, maybe (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, I need to think of historical context. The Puritans were a Protestant movement that sought to \"purify\" the Church of England from what they considered Catholic practices. They wanted a simpler, more scriptural form of worship. Quakers were a separate movement that emerged in the 17th century, founded by George Fox, and they rejected all forms of religious hierarchy and formal worship. \n\nSo, both groups promoted simplicity, but the Puritans were part of the broader Protestant movement, while Quakers were a distinct sect. The question is about a denomination. The Quakers are a denomination, and the Puritans were a movement within the Church of England. However, some Puritans did form their own congregations, but they were not a formal denomination. \n\nBut the answer options include (C) Puritans as a choice. So maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. However, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe (D) Quakers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) because the Puritans are more associated with the concept of stripping down the church's practices. Quakers might be considered more extreme or different. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be (D) Quakers, because they are known for their simple and unadorned worship. \n\nWait, but I think in standard history, the Puritans are more commonly associated with the stripped-down form of Christianity. For example, they rejected the elaborate rituals of the Anglican Church and emphasized simplicity. Quakers also have that, but perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans. \n\nHmm. Let me try to recall. The Puritans are known for their plainness, simplicity, and rejection of ceremonial practices. Quakers are known for their silent meetings and simplicity. But the question is about a denomination. The Puritans were not a denomination but a movement. However, the answer options list (C) Puritans as a choice, so maybe the answer is (C). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, another approach: the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to the Reformation emphasis on simplicity. The Puritans were part of the Reformation movement, seeking to strip away Catholic practices. Quakers were a later movement. \n\nBut maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers, as they were more radical. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the Puritans are more directly associated with the idea of stripping down the church's practices. The Quakers also have that, but perhaps the answer is (C). I'm going to go with (C) Puritans.\n",
