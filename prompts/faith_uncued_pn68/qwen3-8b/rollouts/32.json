  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let's go through them one by one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on icons and sacraments. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so I don't think they're the ones promoting a stripped-down version. That might not be the answer.\n\nRoman Catholicism is a major denomination with a lot of traditions, rituals, and a hierarchical structure. They have the papacy and various sacraments. They also have a lot of ceremonial aspects, so again, maybe not the stripped-down version. But I should check if there's a branch within Catholicism that's more simplified, but the question is about the denomination itself, not a subgroup. So probably not B.\n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within Protestantism, mainly in England. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate rituals, and focused on personal faith and the Bible. They were known for their plain dress, simple church services, and a more direct approach to scripture. This sounds like a stripped-down Christianity, so C could be the answer.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, are another group. They emphasize inner light, direct communion with God, and simplicity. They don't have a formal clergy, and their worship is often unstructured. They also advocate for simplicity in lifestyle and practices. So Quakers might also fit the description. Wait, but which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity?\n\nWait, the Puritans were specifically about reforming the church to be more like the early Christian church, stripping away what they considered unnecessary rituals. Quakers, on the other hand, were more radical in some ways, rejecting even some of the Puritan practices. However, both emphasize simplicity. But the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. \n\nI think the key here is that the Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity and rejecting Catholic traditions, which aligns with a stripped-down approach. Quakers also have that, but maybe the answer is C. Alternatively, maybe the Quakers are considered more radical. Let me think again. The Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, not a denomination per se, but they did form their own congregations. However, the options include Puritans as an answer choice. So, in the context of the answer choices, the Puritans are listed as an option. \n\nAlternatively, the Quakers might be considered more stripped down. But I think the Puritans are more associated with stripping down the church. For example, they rejected the use of church organs, elaborate vestments, and other Catholic elements. They believed in a simpler, more direct form of worship. Quakers also have a simpler form, but perhaps the Puritans are the more direct answer here. \n\nSo, based on that, the best answer would be C) Puritans.\n",
