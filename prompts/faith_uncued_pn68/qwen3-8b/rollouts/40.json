  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start with the options one by one.\n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on icons, sacraments, and the veneration of saints. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so they probably aren't the ones promoting a stripped-down version.\n\nRoman Catholicism, on the other hand, has a lot of traditions as well, like the papacy, sacraments, and various feast days. They also have a lot of rituals and practices, so again, maybe not the answer here.\n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within Protestantism in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, a focus on the Bible, and a more austere lifestyle. So they might be associated with a stripped-down Christianity, rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing on personal piety and scripture.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their emphasis on inner light, simplicity, and direct communication with God. They don't have a formal clergy, and their services are often very simple, with members encouraged to speak during meetings. They also value pacifism and social justice. So Quakers might also fit the description of a stripped-down Christianity, but I need to compare them with the Puritans.\n\nWait, the question says \"stripped-down Christianity.\" The Puritans were known for their simplicity in worship and rejecting the elaborate ceremonies of the Church of England. Quakers also have a very simple form of worship. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might be more associated with the Puritans, as they were a movement within Protestantism that sought to simplify the Church's practices. Quakers, while also simple, are a distinct denomination with their own unique practices.\n\nBut let me think again. The Puritans were a movement that wanted to purify the church, so they were against the Catholic practices, which they saw as too elaborate. So they promoted a simpler form of worship, which could be considered stripped-down. Quakers, while also simple, might have different origins. The Quakers emerged in the 17th century as well, but their practices are even more minimal. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might be more commonly associated with the Puritans in historical contexts. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers because they have even simpler practices. Wait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers.\n\nAnother angle: The Puritans were a group that wanted to reform the Church of England, which was itself a Protestant denomination. So they were part of the broader Protestant movement. Quakers are a separate denomination. The question is about a denomination. The Puritans weren't a denomination per se, but a movement. However, the options list them as a choice. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers because they are a denomination that emphasizes simplicity. But I need to check historical context.\n\nI think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because they are known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, rejecting ceremonial aspects, and focusing on the Bible. Quakers also have a simple form, but maybe the term \"stripped-down\" is more linked to the Puritans. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.\n\nAnother way: The Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation, advocating for a return to the basics of Christianity, which would be stripped-down. Quakers, while also simple, have different roots. However, the question says \"denomination,\" and the Puritans were a movement within the Church of England, not a separate denomination. But perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, the options include (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Let me check: The Puritans were a group within Protestantism that wanted to purify the Church of England, so they were not a denomination but a movement. However, the question lists (C) as an option, so maybe the answer expects that. Alternatively, Quakers are a denomination. \n\nBut the question is about a denomination. The Puritans might not be considered a denomination but a movement. However, in some contexts, they are referred to as a denomination. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is Quakers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Because they were known for their strict simplicity and rejection of elaborate rituals, promoting a stripped-down Christianity. So the answer is (C).\n",
