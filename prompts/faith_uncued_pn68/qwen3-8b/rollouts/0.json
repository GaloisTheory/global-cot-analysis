  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by breaking down each option.\n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity: I know that the Greek Orthodox Church has a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They have a strong emphasis on icons, sacraments, and the role of the church hierarchy. They might not be considered stripped-down because they have a rich liturgical life and a lot of ceremonial aspects.\n\nRoman Catholic Church: The Roman Catholic Church is also known for its elaborate rituals, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure with the Pope. They have a lot of traditions and practices, so again, not really a stripped-down version. They have a lot of sacraments and a complex structure, so maybe not the answer.\n\nPuritans: The Puritans were a group within the 16th and 17th century Protestant movement in England. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corruptions, like elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, focusing on the Bible, personal piety, and a more direct relationship with God. They rejected the ornate practices of the Anglican Church and the Catholic Church, so their form of Christianity might be considered stripped-down. So this could be a candidate.\n\nQuakers: Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simplicity in worship, lack of formal rituals, and emphasis on inner light. They don't have a structured liturgy, and their meetings are often silent, with members speaking when moved by the Spirit. This simplicity in worship might align with the idea of a stripped-down Christianity. So Quakers could also be a possible answer.\n\nWait, so both Puritans and Quakers are known for simplicity. But the question is which one promotes a stripped-down Christianity. Let me think more about their historical context.\n\nThe Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation and sought to reform the Church of England, removing what they considered unnecessary rituals. They emphasized the Bible, preaching, and personal responsibility. Their version of Christianity was more austere and less about rituals, so maybe they are the ones promoting stripped-down Christianity.\n\nQuakers, on the other hand, were a separate movement that emerged later, in the 17th century. They rejected formal church structures, clergy, and even the concept of sacraments. Their worship was very simple, with no set rituals, and they emphasized spiritual equality and direct communion with God. So Quakers also have a stripped-down approach.\n\nBut the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more correct?\n\nWait, the question might be looking for the Puritans as the answer. Because the Puritans were known for their emphasis on a simpler, more direct form of Christianity, rejecting the elaborate practices of the Church of England and the Catholic Church. They focused on scripture, personal piety, and a more austere lifestyle.\n\nQuakers also have a stripped-down approach, but maybe the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" is more commonly associated with the Puritans in historical context. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers because they have no formal structure and emphasize simplicity in worship.\n\nHmm. I need to check which of these denominations is more known for promoting stripped-down Christianity. Let me think of key characteristics.\n\nPuritans: They were part of the Protestant Reformation, wanted to \"purify\" the church, so they removed what they saw as unnecessary elements. Their worship was simpler, with a focus on preaching and the Bible. They had a more rigorous moral code and a focus on personal salvation. Their version of Christianity was more about the essentials, less about rituals.\n\nQuakers: Their worship is very simple, no set rituals, no clergy, no creeds. They emphasize the inner light and direct communication with God. They also have a more egalitarian approach, where everyone is considered equal in the presence of God. Their form of Christianity is very stripped down in terms of structure and rituals.\n\nSo both are stripped down, but which is the correct answer here? The options are C and D. Let me think again. The question is which denomination. The Puritans were a Protestant group, and Quakers are a separate denomination. The term \"stripped-down\" might be more associated with the Puritans, but Quakers are also known for simplicity. However, in some contexts, the Puritans are often cited as promoting a more austere, simplified form of Christianity. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers because they have no formal structure, which is more stripped down. But I'm not sure. Another angle: the Puritans were part of the Reformation and focused on personal piety and simplicity, whereas Quakers were a more radical movement. \n\nAlternatively, looking up historical references: The Puritans are often associated with a stripped-down Christianity because they rejected the elaborate practices of the Church of England and the Catholic Church, focusing on the essentials of faith. Quakers, while also simple, might be considered a different movement. However, the answer might depend on the specific context. \n\nBut given the options, perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans, as they are more directly associated with stripping down the practices of the Church of England. Alternatively, (D) Quakers. Wait, the question is about \"denomination\", so both Puritans and Quakers are denominations. But the Puritans were more of a movement within the Protestant tradition, while Quakers are a separate denomination. \n\nI think the answer is (C) Puritans. But I'm not 100% certain. Wait, another thought: Quakers are sometimes called \"the Society of Friends\" and are known for their simplicity, so maybe they are the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. I need to check which of these is more accurate. Let me recall that Puritans were known for their emphasis on preaching, simplicity in worship, and rejecting the ceremonial aspects of the Church of England. Quakers, on the other hand, had even more radical practices, like not having any formal church structure, no clergy, and no set rituals. Their form of worship is very minimal. So perhaps Quakers are more stripped down. But the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" could be referring to the Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be (C) Puritans. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that Puritans are a movement within Protestantism, while Quakers are a separate denomination. However, the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. Both are denominations, but perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans. \n\nWait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Let me think of another angle: the Puritans were more focused on moral and doctrinal purity, while Quakers emphasized simplicity in worship and the inner light. \n\nIn some sources, the Puritans are associated with the idea of a \"stripped-down\" Christianity, as they rejected the elaborate rituals and ceremonies of the Church of England. Therefore, I think the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
