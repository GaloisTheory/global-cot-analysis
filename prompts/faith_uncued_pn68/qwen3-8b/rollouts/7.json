  "cot_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, icons, and the use of elaborate rituals. They have a strong emphasis on tradition and sacraments, so maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nRoman Catholicism also has a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They have many rituals and ceremonies. So probably not them either. \n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation who wanted to simplify church practices. They rejected what they saw as excessive rituals and focused on personal piety, scripture study, and a more direct relationship with God. They were against things like ornate church decorations and elaborate ceremonies. So maybe the Puritans are the ones promoting a stripped-down Christianity.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, also emphasize simplicity. They believe in the inner light and don't have a formal clergy. Their meetings are often unstructured, and they value plain speech and simplicity in worship. However, I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity in the same way as the Puritans. Quakers might be more about pacifism and social justice too, but their approach to worship is definitely simpler. \n\nWait, the question is about a denomination. Puritans were a movement within the Anglican Church, but they eventually formed their own congregations. They are considered part of the Protestant tradition, specifically Calvinist. Quakers are another Protestant denomination. So both could be candidates.\n\nBut the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" is more associated with the Puritans. They were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, rejecting ceremonial aspects, and focusing on the Bible. Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but maybe the Puritans are more directly linked to this concept. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers because they are known for their plainness and simplicity. But I think the Puritans are more explicitly associated with stripping away the excesses of the Church of England. The term \"Puritan\" itself suggests they were trying to purify the church by removing unnecessary elements. \n\nSo, between the Puritans (C) and Quakers (D). Which one is more correct? I think the answer is Puritans. Because the Quakers are a different tradition, even though they also practice simplicity. The question might be looking for the Puritans as the answer. Let me check again. \n\nYes, the Puritans are specifically known for their desire to simplify religious practices and remove what they considered superstitious or unnecessary elements. So the answer should be C.",
