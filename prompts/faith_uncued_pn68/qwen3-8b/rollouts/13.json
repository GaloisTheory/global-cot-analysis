  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let's start with the options one by one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, including elaborate liturgies, icons, and hierarchical structure. They have a lot of rituals and sacraments, so they probably aren't the ones promoting a stripped-down version. So maybe not option A.\n\nRoman Catholicism is another major denomination. They also have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a centralized authority in the Pope. They have a comprehensive liturgy and many rituals, so again, not likely the answer. So B might not be correct either.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Protestant movement in the 16th and 17th centuries. They were known for wanting to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized a simplified worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing on personal faith and the Bible. They promoted a more austere and stripped-down form of Christianity. That makes me think option C could be the answer.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another group. They are known for their simplicity in worship, emphasizing inner light and direct communion with God. They don't have a formal hierarchy and their services are often unstructured. However, I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination that promotes a stripped-down Christianity. They do have a distinct approach, but I think the Puritans are more specifically associated with this idea of stripping away Catholic practices. \n\nWait, but Quakers are also known for their simplicity. However, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might more directly refer to the Puritans' focus on simplifying worship and rejecting ceremonial aspects. The Puritans were part of the Reformation and wanted to return to what they saw as the purest form of Christianity, which was more about personal faith and less about rituals. \n\nSo comparing the options, the Puritans (C) are more likely the answer. Quakers (D) are also simple but maybe not as focused on stripping down as the Puritans. The question is about a denomination, and Quakers are a denomination, but the Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, but they are often considered as a denomination themselves. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.\n",
