  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox. They are one of the oldest Christian traditions, right? They have a lot of rituals, icons, and emphasis on tradition. I think they have a rich liturgical life, so maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach. So maybe not option A.\n\nThen Roman Catholic. The Roman Catholic Church has a lot of sacraments, a structured hierarchy, and a lot of traditions. They also have a lot of rituals and ceremonies. So they might not be the ones promoting a stripped-down version. So B might not be correct either.\n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in the 16th and 17th centuries who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary rituals and ceremonies. They believed in a simpler form of worship, focusing more on the Bible and personal faith. So they might be the ones who promoted a stripped-down Christianity. That makes me think option C could be the answer.\n\nQuakers, which is option D. The Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simple worship practices, absence of formal clergy, and emphasis on the inner light. They also have a very plain style of worship, which might be considered stripped-down. But wait, how does that compare to the Puritans?\n\nHmm. The Puritans were more about reforming the Church of England, while Quakers were a separate movement. Both might have stripped-down aspects, but I think the Puritans are more associated with simplifying worship practices, such as removing elaborate rituals, emphasizing preaching, and a more direct relationship with God. Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but maybe they are considered more radical or different in other ways. \n\nWait, but the question is about promoting stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity, so they might be the correct answer. However, Quakers also have a simple form of worship. Let me check again.\n\nThe Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation, and they wanted to remove what they saw as unnecessary elements from the Church of England, like elaborate ceremonies, which would make their version of Christianity more stripped down. Quakers, on the other hand, were a separate movement, founded in the 17th century, and they rejected formal religious structures, including the use of clergy and set rituals. Their worship is very simple, with no set order, and they emphasize direct communion with God. \n\nBut the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. Both Puritans and Quakers could fit, but I need to see which one is more associated with that. The term \"stripped-down\" might refer to more simplicity in worship and practice. The Puritans are often associated with the Calvinist tradition, which emphasizes the sovereignty of God and the importance of the Bible, with simpler services. Quakers are more known for their unique practices, like silent meetings and no set liturgy. \n\nHowever, the answer options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more correct? I think the Puritans are more directly linked to promoting a stripped-down version of Christianity. Quakers are also a simpler form, but maybe the answer expects Puritans. Alternatively, perhaps the Quakers are considered more stripped down because of their lack of rituals. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the question says \"denomination\". Quakers are a denomination, as are Puritans (though they were a group within the Church of England, not a separate denomination). But maybe the answer is Quakers. However, I think the key here is that the Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship and rejecting ceremonial practices. So the answer might be (C) Puritans. Alternatively, maybe (D) Quakers. \n\nI need to be careful here. Let me think again. The Puritans were part of the Reformation and wanted to purify the church, stripping away what they considered superstitious or unnecessary. Quakers, on the other hand, were a radical sect that rejected hierarchical structures and formal sacraments. Both could be considered as promoting a stripped-down approach. However, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more commonly associated with the Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that Quakers are more known for their simple worship without any set form, which is a stripped-down approach. But I think the answer intended here is (C) Puritans. Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me check some key points. The Puritans did advocate for a simpler form of worship, removing the use of elaborate ceremonies, which aligns with the idea of stripped-down. Quakers also have a simple form, but perhaps the question is referring to the Puritans as a denomination (though they were more of a movement). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. But I'm getting confused. Let me think of historical context. The Puritans were a group within the Church of England, not a separate denomination. Quakers, however, are a distinct denomination. So if the question is about a denomination, then Quakers would be a denomination, while Puritans were a movement. But the options are given as choices, and the answer is among them. \n\nThe question is from a test, so maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Or perhaps (D) Quakers. Wait, the term \"stripped-down\" might refer to the Quakers' rejection of formal religious structures. But I think the correct answer is (C) Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, I might be mixing up. Let me think again. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity, plainness, and a focus on the Bible. Quakers are also known for simplicity. However, the Puritans were part of the Reformation, and their movement was to strip away the excesses of the Church of England. So the answer is (C) Puritans. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is (C).\n",
