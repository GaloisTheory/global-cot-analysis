  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox. They are one of the oldest Christian denominations, emphasizing tradition, liturgy, and the use of icons. They have a rich tradition and rituals, so I don't think they are known for being stripped-down. They probably have a lot of ceremonies and sacraments.\n\nNext, Roman Catholic. The Roman Catholic Church has a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They also have a lot of theological traditions and practices. They aren't typically seen as stripped-down. They have a comprehensive system of beliefs and practices, so maybe not the answer here.\n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within Protestantism in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing on personal piety and the Bible. They were known for their strict moral codes and simplicity in worship, so this might align with the idea of a stripped-down Christianity.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and direct communication with God. They don't have a formal hierarchy or set of creeds. Their services are usually unstructured and emphasize spiritual experiences over rituals. They also advocate for social justice and pacifism. So Quakers might also be considered stripped-down in terms of their practices, but I need to compare them with the Puritans.\n\nWait, the question is about a denomination. Quakers are a denomination, as are the others. But the Puritans were more of a movement within Protestantism, particularly in England and America. However, they did form their own congregations and denominations later on. But the term \"Puritan\" is often used to describe their approach to Christianity, which was more about simplifying worship and focusing on personal faith rather than elaborate ceremonies.\n\nSo comparing Puritans and Quakers, both have elements of simplicity. However, Quakers are known for their lack of formal rituals and emphasis on spiritual equality. The Puritans were more focused on reforming the Church of England, but their approach was to simplify worship, remove what they saw as unnecessary elements, and focus on the Bible. \n\nBut the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to a more austere or simplified form. The Puritans did emphasize simplicity in worship, rejecting things like elaborate ceremonies, music, and even the use of hymns. They were more about personal devotion and the authority of the Bible. Quakers, on the other hand, have a very different structure, without ministers or formal services. They might be considered more stripped down in terms of structure and rituals.\n\nBut which one is more commonly associated with promoting a stripped-down Christianity? I think the Puritans are often cited as advocating for a simpler, more direct form of Christianity, focusing on the essentials. Quakers also fit, but maybe the answer is Puritans. Alternatively, maybe the Quakers are considered more stripped down because they don't have the same structure as the Puritans. \n\nWait, the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. The question is which one. Let me think again. The Puritans were a group within Protestantism that sought to simplify worship, remove Catholic practices, and focus on the Bible. They were known for their emphasis on personal piety and simplicity. Quakers, while also simple in their practices, might be considered more radical in their approach. However, the term \"stripped down\" might be more aligned with the Puritans' efforts to reform the Church of England by stripping away what they saw as unnecessary elements. \n\nAlternatively, Quakers are known for their simplicity in worship, no set order, and minimal rituals. So maybe both could be considered. But the question is about a denomination. The Puritans eventually formed their own denominations, like the Congregationalists. Quakers are a distinct denomination. \n\nBut perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans. Because they are more directly associated with the idea of stripping down the Church's practices. However, I'm a bit confused between C and D. Let me check if there's any other clue. The question says \"stripped-down Christianity,\" which might imply a more austere form. The Puritans were known for their strict moral codes and simplicity, but Quakers are even more so in their practices. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might refer to the liturgical simplicity. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be Quakers. Wait, I think the correct answer here is (C) Puritans. Because they were part of the Protestant Reformation and emphasized simplicity in worship. Quakers are a different movement, though. \n\nWait, but some sources might say that the Quakers are considered more stripped down. However, I think in general, the Puritans are more commonly associated with promoting a stripped-down Christianity. Therefore, I think the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
