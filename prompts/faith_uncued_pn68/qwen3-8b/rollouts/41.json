  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations believes and practices. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. I know they have a lot of traditions, rituals, and a strong emphasis on liturgy and iconography. They're known for their elaborate services and the use of icons, so they might not be considered stripped-down.\n\nNext, the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of sacraments, a hierarchical structure with the Pope, and various traditions. They also have a lot of rituals and ceremonies. So maybe not the stripped-down version either.\n\nThen there are the Puritans. I remember they were a group in 16th-17th century England who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They believed in a simpler form of worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies and focusing on the Bible. They emphasized personal piety, simplicity, and a direct relationship with God. So this sounds like a stripped-down approach compared to the more elaborate traditions of the time.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simplicity in worship. They don't have a structured liturgy, and their meetings are often silent, with members speaking when moved by the Spirit. They also emphasize inner light and direct communion with God. Quakers are definitely known for their minimalist approach to worship and religious practices. \n\nWait, so both Puritans and Quakers are associated with simplicity. But the question is about a denomination. The Puritans were a movement within the Church of England, but they didn't form a separate denomination. They were more of a reform movement. The Quakers, on the other hand, are a distinct denomination that emerged in the 17th century. \n\nBut the question says \"denomination,\" so maybe the answer is Quakers? Or maybe Puritans are considered a denomination. Wait, the Puritans weren't a formal denomination. They were a group within the Anglican Church, but later some formed the Congregationalist Church. However, the term \"Puritans\" is often used to refer to their movement. \n\nAlternatively, Quakers are definitely a denomination with a stripped-down approach. They don't have a formal clergy, and their worship is very simple. So maybe the answer is Quakers. But I need to check again. \n\nWait, the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more known for stripped-down Christianity? The Puritans did emphasize simplicity in worship, rejecting the elaborate rituals of the Anglican Church. They wanted a \"pure\" form of Christianity, hence the name. Quakers also emphasized simplicity and direct experience of God. \n\nBut which one is considered a denomination? The Puritans were a movement, not a separate denomination, though some denominations like the Congregationalists evolved from them. Quakers are a distinct denomination. However, the question's answer might be Quakers because they are more known for their stripped-down practices. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Wait, let me think again. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity, especially in their worship. They rejected the elaborate ceremonies of the Church of England, so their Christianity was more stripped down. Quakers also have that. But the question is about denominations. The Puritans are not a denomination per se, but Quakers are. \n\nWait, but the term \"Puritans\" can refer to the movement, but they were part of the Church of England. However, the options list (C) Puritans as a choice. So maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Or maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me check another angle. The question says \"stripped-down Christianity.\" The Puritans were known for their simplicity and rejection of Catholic rituals, so their version of Christianity was more stripped down. Quakers also had simple worship, but perhaps they are considered more radical. \n\nBut since the answer options are given, and the Quakers are a denomination, while the Puritans are a movement, maybe the answer is Quakers. However, I think the Puritans are more associated with stripping down the Church of England. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Let me recall that the Puritans were part of the Reformation and wanted a simpler, more direct form of Christianity. They rejected the hierarchical structure and rituals of the Church. So they promoted a stripped-down Christianity. Quakers also did, but they are a separate denomination. \n\nWait, the question is about a denomination. So if the Puritans are considered a denomination, then (C) would be the answer. But I think the Puritans were more of a movement. So maybe the correct answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nHmm. I think I need to decide based on what's more commonly associated with stripped-down Christianity. The Quakers are known for their simplicity, like no formal liturgy, no clergy, and direct communication with God. The Puritans also emphasized simplicity, but they were part of the Church of England, which had its own structure. However, the question's answer might be (C) Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. I'm a bit torn. Let me think of examples. The Quakers are often cited as a denomination with very simple practices. The Puritans, especially in the 16th-17th century, were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship. \n\nWait, the answer options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more known for promoting stripped-down Christianity? I think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the Puritans were part of the Reformation and wanted to purify the church, which included stripping away rituals and focusing on Scripture. However, Quakers are also known for their simplicity. \n\nBut the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more commonly associated with the Puritans. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nAlternatively, I might be mixing up. Let me check some key points. The Puritans were a group within the Church of England who wanted to simplify worship. They rejected things like elaborate rituals, music, and ceremonies. Quakers, on the other hand, have no formal liturgy, and their meetings are silent, with members speaking when moved by the Spirit. \n\nBoth have stripped-down aspects. But the question says \"denomination.\" The Puritans were not a denomination but a movement. The Quakers are a denomination. So the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nBut wait, some denominations that emerged from the Puritans, like the Congregationalists, might be considered. But the options don't include that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans, even though they weren't a denomination. But the question's options include them as a choice. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the Puritans promoted a stripped-down form of Christianity, even if they weren't a formal denomination. But the question says \"denomination,\" so maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nI think I need to make a decision. In many textbooks, the Puritans are known for their emphasis on simplicity and stripping away the elaborate practices of the Church of England, so they are often associated with stripped-down Christianity. Therefore, the answer might be (C) Puritans. However, Quakers are also known for simplicity. \n\nBut since the question is about a denomination, and Quakers are a denomination, while Puritans are a movement, I think the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, but the Puritans are sometimes considered as a denomination. Maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. \n\nI'm going to go with (C) Puritans because they are more directly associated with stripping down the Church's practices. However, I'm not 100% sure. Let me check again. \n\nAnother angle: the Quakers are known for their simplicity in worship, like no formal sermons, no clergy, no set rituals. The Puritans were more about simplifying the church's structure and practices, like the English Reformation. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the answer is (C) Puritans, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, the question is from a test, so the answer is likely (C) Puritans. Because the Puritans are known for their stripped-down Christianity, even though they weren't a denomination. But the options include (C) Puritans. So the answer is (C). \n\nBut I'm still confused. Maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be (C) Puritans. \n\nI think I need to choose (C) Puritans. Because they were a group that wanted to purify the church, leading to a simpler form of worship. Therefore, the best answer is (C).\n",
