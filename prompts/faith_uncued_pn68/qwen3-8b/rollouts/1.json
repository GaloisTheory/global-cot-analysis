  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The answer choices are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start by thinking about each one.\n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They have a lot of ceremonies, icons, and a strong emphasis on sacraments. So I don't think they are the ones promoting a stripped-down version. They might be more about tradition and elaborate worship.\n\nRoman Catholicism also has a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a structured hierarchy. They have the Pope and a lot of traditions. While there are some reform movements within Catholicism, the mainstream is not considered stripped-down. So probably not option B.\n\nNow, Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They focused on personal faith, scripture, and a more direct relationship with God. So this sounds like a stripped-down Christianity. They didn't like the ornate practices, so they might be the answer.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They are known for their plain dress, simple worship without formal rituals, and emphasis on inner light. They don't have a structured hierarchy, and their meetings are often silent. This also seems like a stripped-down approach. But wait, the question is about a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity. Quakers are a distinct group, but maybe they are considered part of the broader Protestant tradition. However, the Puritans were more of a movement within the Church of England, whereas Quakers were a separate group. But the question is about denominations, so both are denominations.\n\nWait, but which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity? The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity, plainness, and rejecting ceremonial aspects. Quakers also emphasize simplicity, but maybe the Puritans are more directly associated with stripping down the practices of the Church. Also, the term \"stripped-down\" might refer to removing unnecessary elements, which the Puritans did. Quakers might be more about simplicity in their worship but perhaps not as focused on stripping down the Church's practices. However, I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both Puritans and Quakers fit. But looking at the answer choices, only one is correct. Let me think again. The Puritans were part of the Reformation and wanted to simplify the Church's practices, while Quakers were a more radical group that rejected even the structure of the Church. But the question is about a denomination. The Quakers are a denomination, so both are denominations. However, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more aligned with the Puritans because they were part of the Protestant movement that emphasized simplicity in worship, plain dress, and a focus on the Bible. Quakers also have similar traits, but perhaps in the context of the question, the answer is Puritans. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers. Wait, but I need to check.\n\nWait, the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Let me recall. The Puritans were a group that wanted to purify the Church of England, so they opposed the Catholic practices and wanted a simpler form of worship. They did not like the elaborate rituals and were more focused on the essentials of the faith. Quakers, on the other hand, were a more radical group that rejected the need for clergy, formal liturgy, and even the concept of sacraments. They emphasized direct communication with God through the Inner Light. So both have elements of stripped-down Christianity, but which one is the answer here?\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the question is about a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans are a denomination, or more accurately, a movement within Protestantism. However, Quakers are also a denomination. But perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. I need to think about historical context. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity, plainness, and a focus on personal piety. They rejected the ornate practices of the Church of England. Quakers also rejected traditional forms of worship and had a very simple, unstructured service. But the question is which one is the answer. Maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. However, sometimes Quakers are considered more radical. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. Wait, but the term \"stripped-down\" might refer to removing the structure and formality. Quakers are known for their simplicity in worship, absence of clergy, and lack of formal rituals. So perhaps (D) Quakers. But I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall some key points. The Puritans were part of the Reformation, and they wanted to simplify the Church's practices, so they might be the answer. However, Quakers are also known for their stripped-down practices. Maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (D). \n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"stripped-down Christianity.\" The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity, plainness, and a focus on the essentials of the faith, which could be seen as stripped-down. Quakers also have stripped-down practices. But perhaps in the context of the answer choices, the answer is (C) Puritans. However, I might be mixing up the details. Alternatively, the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should check which of these groups is more commonly associated with promoting a stripped-down form. The Puritans were a movement within the 16th and 17th century Protestantism that sought to purify the Church of England from what they saw as excessive rituals and ceremonies. They emphasized a more direct relationship with God, simplicity in worship, and a focus on the Bible. Quakers, on the other hand, were a separate group that emerged in the 17th century, emphasizing inner light and simplicity. So both are associated with stripped-down practices, but the question is which one is the answer. \n\nGiven that the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers, and the question is about a denomination promoting stripped-down Christianity, perhaps both are correct, but since the answer choices only allow one, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, I think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the term \"stripped-down\" often refers to the Puritan movement's rejection of elaborate church practices. Quakers are more known for their radical simplicity, but maybe the answer is (C). However, I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe (D) Quakers. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the Puritans were part of the broader Protestant movement that rejected Catholic practices, leading to a simpler form of Christianity. So I think the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
