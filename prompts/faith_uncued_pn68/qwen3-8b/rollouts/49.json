  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations believes and practices. Stripped-down Christianity usually refers to a more simplified or less ritualistic form of Christianity, focusing on the basics like the core teachings of Jesus, maybe rejecting elaborate rituals or hierarchical structures.\n\nGreek Orthodox is a branch of Eastern Christianity. They have a lot of traditions, icons, liturgy, and a strong emphasis on sacraments. They also have a complex hierarchy with the Patriarch and various rituals. So probably not them.\n\nRoman Catholic Church is the largest Christian denomination. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, liturgy, and a hierarchical structure with the Pope. They also have a lot of rituals and doctrines. So maybe not the answer either.\n\nPuritans were a group in 16th-17th century England. They were Protestants who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies, and focused on the Bible as the sole authority. They were known for their strict moral codes and plain dress. This sounds like stripped-down Christianity. So Puritans might be the answer.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another denomination. They emphasize personal revelation and inner light, and their worship is quite simple, often without a formal structure. They don't have a hierarchy, and their meetings are more about silent contemplation. They also reject formal creeds and rituals. So Quakers also have a stripped-down approach.\n\nWait, but the question is which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. The options are Puritans and Quakers. Which one is more associated with that? Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, but Quakers are even more minimalistic. But maybe the term \"stripped-down\" is more commonly associated with the Puritans. Alternatively, Quakers might be considered more stripped down. However, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more aligned with the Puritans because they were part of the Protestant Reformation and focused on simplifying church practices. Quakers are a different movement, more focused on inner spirituality. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be Quakers. Let me think again. The Puritans were a group within the Church of England who wanted to purify it, so their approach was to strip away Catholic practices. Quakers are a separate denomination, founded in the 17th century. They emphasize simplicity, but maybe the term \"stripped-down\" is more commonly linked to Puritans. However, some sources might associate Quakers with simplicity. \n\nWait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. The question is which one. Maybe the answer is Puritans. Because the Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, plain dress, and a focus on the Bible. They rejected elaborate rituals. Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but they are a different movement. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might be more directly associated with the Puritans. Alternatively, the answer might be Quakers because they have even more minimalistic practices, like no formal clergy and no set rituals. \n\nI think the key here is that Puritans were a movement within Protestantism that sought to strip away what they considered unnecessary elements of the Church, like elaborate ceremonies, whereas Quakers are a different group. But I'm not sure. Let me check some facts. Puritans did advocate for a simpler form of worship, but they were part of a larger movement. Quakers are known for their simplicity in worship, but they are a distinct denomination. The answer might depend on which one is more commonly associated with \"stripped-down.\" In some contexts, Puritans are considered to have a stripped-down approach. Alternatively, Quakers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers. For example, Quakers have no formal liturgy, no set order of service, and emphasize inner light. So their form of Christianity is stripped down. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might be more associated with the Puritans. But I'm not certain. Let me think again. The question is about a denomination. Puritans are not a denomination per se, but a movement within Protestantism, but the options include (C) Puritans. Quakers are a denomination. So maybe the answer is Quakers. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. The question is which denomination promotes stripped-down. Puritans were a group that wanted to purify the Church of England, but they were not a separate denomination. However, the option is (C) Puritans, so perhaps the answer is Puritans. Alternatively, Quakers are a denomination. \n\nI think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because they were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship and stripping away Catholic practices. Quakers are also simple, but perhaps the term is more commonly associated with Puritans. Alternatively, the answer could be Quakers. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. Given that Puritans are a Protestant movement that emphasized simplicity, I think the answer is (C) Puritans. However, I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, another angle: Stripped-down Christianity might be called \"Pietism\" or \"Methodism,\" but those aren't in the options. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, Quakers. So among these, Quakers are known for their simplicity, but Puritans as well. However, the term \"stripped-down\" is more commonly associated with the Puritans. Therefore, the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
