  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They are known for their rich traditions, elaborate rituals, and emphasis on liturgy. They have a lot of sacraments and a strong emphasis on church tradition, so I don't think they fit the \"stripped-down\" description.\n\nNext, Roman Catholicism. The Roman Catholic Church has a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They also have a lot of traditions and practices, so again, maybe not the stripped-down version. However, I should note that some Catholic movements might be more simplified, but the denomination as a whole isn't known for that.\n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the 16th and 17th century Protestant movement. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, a focus on the Bible, and a more direct relationship with God. They rejected elaborate rituals and ceremonies, so this seems to align with stripped-down Christianity. They advocated for a more austere and simplified form of worship, which matches the term \"stripped-down.\"\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another group. They emphasize inner light and personal revelation, and their worship is very informal, without formal rituals. They also reject hierarchical structures and emphasize simplicity. However, I'm not sure if \"stripped-down\" is the best term for them. They might be more about simplicity and direct experience rather than a stripped-down version of Christianity. But compared to the Puritans, I think the Puritans are more focused on simplifying the practices of the Church, whereas Quakers might have a different approach.\n\nWait, the question is about promoting a stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were known for their desire to simplify worship and remove what they considered unnecessary elements, like elaborate ceremonies and hierarchical structures. Their emphasis on Scripture and personal faith could be seen as a stripped-down form. Quakers also have a simpler form, but perhaps the Puritans are more directly associated with this idea. \n\nSo, considering the options, the Puritans (C) would be the answer. The other denominations either have more elaborate traditions (Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic) or have different focuses (Quakers). Therefore, the answer should be (C) Puritans.\n",
