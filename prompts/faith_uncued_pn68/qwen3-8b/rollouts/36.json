  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is one of the oldest branches, right? They have a lot of traditions, rituals, and icons. They also have a hierarchical structure with the Patriarch. I don't think they're known for being stripped down. They probably have a lot of ceremonies and liturgies.\n\nRoman Catholicism is another major branch. They have the Pope, a lot of sacraments, and various traditions. They also have a lot of rituals and liturgical practices. So maybe not the stripped-down version either. Although some might argue that they have a lot of structure, but I think the key here is \"stripped down.\"\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within Protestantism in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies and rituals. They believed in a more direct relationship with God, focusing on the Bible and personal faith. So they might fit the description of stripped-down Christianity. \n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another denomination. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and direct communion with God. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their meetings are often silent. They also reject certain rituals like the use of clergy and sacraments. But I'm not sure if they are considered as promoting a stripped-down Christianity compared to the Puritans. \n\nWait, but the question is about which denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity, plainness, and a return to the basics of the faith. They rejected the ornate practices of the Church of England and other Catholic traditions. So their approach was to strip away the excesses and focus on the essentials. \n\nQuakers also have a simple form of worship, but I think the Puritans are more directly associated with the idea of stripping down the church. The Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic are more traditional and have more elaborate practices. \n\nSo between the options, the Puritans (C) would be the answer. Quakers (D) might be a contender, but I think the Puritans are more known for this aspect. Let me check my memory again. Yes, the Puritans were known for their strict adherence to simplicity in worship and their desire to remove all unnecessary elements from the church, making their form of Christianity more stripped down. Therefore, the answer should be C.\n",
