  "cot_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start with the basics. Stripped-down Christianity might refer to a simpler form of worship, less emphasis on rituals, or maybe more focus on personal faith rather than church traditions.\n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich liturgy, icons, and elaborate ceremonies. They have a lot of traditions and sacraments, so probably not the one that's stripped down. So (A) might not be the answer.\n\nRoman Catholicism has a lot of sacraments and rituals as well. They have a structured church hierarchy and various traditions. But again, they're not known for being stripped down. So (B) seems unlikely.\n\nNow, Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as excessive practices. They emphasized a simple form of worship, rejecting things like elaborate music, ornate churches, and other ceremonial aspects. They focused on personal Bible reading, preaching, and a direct relationship with God. So this sounds like \"stripped-down\" Christianity. That makes (C) a strong candidate.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, emphasize inner light and spiritual equality. They don't have traditional church services with clergy, and their meetings are often silent. However, they do have some unique practices but aren't necessarily known for being the most stripped down in terms of structure. Their approach is more about simplicity and direct communion with God, but I'm not sure if they are specifically associated with stripping down Christianity as much as the Puritans.\n\nWait, but the term \"stripped-down\" could be interpreted differently. Maybe it's about minimalism in practices. The Puritans definitely sought to simplify worship and remove what they considered unnecessary elements. Quakers also have a simple approach, but I think the Puritans are more specifically known for that. \n\nSo comparing (C) and (D), I think the answer is (C) Puritans. The Quakers are more about inner light and silence, but the Puritans are directly associated with simplifying Christianity. Therefore, the best choice should be (C).",
