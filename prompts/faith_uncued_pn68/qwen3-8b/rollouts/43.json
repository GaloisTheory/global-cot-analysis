  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They are known for their rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on icons and sacraments. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nNext, the Roman Catholic Church. They have a comprehensive set of doctrines, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They also have a lot of traditions and rituals. So I don't think they're the answer either, since they're not known for being minimalistic.\n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Church of England in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church of what they saw as unnecessary practices, like elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, focusing more on scripture and personal piety. So this sounds like a stripped-down approach. They rejected things like music in church services and other traditional practices, aiming for a more direct and personal relationship with God through the Bible.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another option. They are known for their simplicity in worship, not using formal liturgy or sacraments. They emphasize inner light and direct communion with God. However, I think Quakers might be more about simplicity in their practices, but the question is about a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were more about reforming the church to be simpler, while Quakers might have developed their own distinct practices. \n\nWait, but the question is about a denomination. Quakers are a denomination, as are the others. So comparing the Puritans and Quakers. The Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, specifically within Anglicanism, and they were known for their emphasis on simplicity and rejecting Catholic practices. Quakers, on the other hand, were a separate movement that also valued simplicity but had different theological beliefs. \n\nBut the question is about which one \"promotes a stripped-down Christianity.\" The Puritans were known for their emphasis on a \"pure\" form of Christianity, stripping away what they considered to be unnecessary elements. They wanted to return to the basics of the faith as they saw it in the Bible. Quakers also had a stripped-down approach, but perhaps the Puritans are more directly associated with this concept. \n\nSo, considering the answer choices, the correct answer is likely (C) Puritans. The others are more traditional or have different emphases. Let me double-check: Greek Orthodox are traditional, Roman Catholic is traditional, Quakers are also simpler but maybe not as focused on stripping down as the Puritans. Yes, the Puritans are the ones who specifically sought to simplify the church's practices, so the answer should be C.\n",
