  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They are known for their rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on sacraments. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nThen there's the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of traditions, rituals, and a hierarchical structure. They also have a lot of sacraments and elaborate religious practices. So again, not really stripped down. \n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in the 16th and 17th centuries who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corruption and excess. They believed in a simpler form of worship, focusing on the Bible and personal piety. They rejected elaborate rituals and emphasized preaching and the simplicity of the faith. That sounds like a stripped-down Christianity. \n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another group. They emphasize direct spiritual experience and inner light. They don't have a formal clergy, and their services are usually very simple, with no set liturgy. They also reject hierarchical structures. So Quakers might also be considered as having a stripped-down approach. \n\nWait, but the question is about a denomination. The Puritans were a movement within the Church of England, but they weren't a separate denomination. They were part of the Anglican Church. However, some Puritan groups did form their own congregations. Quakers, on the other hand, are a distinct denomination. \n\nBut the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more associated with the Puritans because they were known for their emphasis on simplicity, rejecting ceremonial aspects, and focusing on a personal relationship with God. Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but maybe the term is more commonly linked to the Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, the Quakers are often seen as having a very minimalistic approach, with no formal rituals. However, the Puritans were more focused on reforming the Church of England from within, emphasizing the Bible and simplicity in worship. \n\nSo, which one is more correct? The question is about a denomination. The Puritans were a group, not a denomination. But maybe the answer is Quakers. Wait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, the Puritans were a movement, but they were part of the broader Protestant tradition. Quakers are a distinct denomination. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might refer to the Puritans' rejection of elaborate ceremonies. \n\nAlternatively, the Quakers are known for their simplicity in worship, but maybe the answer is Puritans. \n\nHmm, I need to check. Let me think again. The Puritans were known for their desire to simplify the Church of England's practices, rejecting things like elaborate rituals, stained glass, and other ornate elements. They emphasized a more direct, personal relationship with God through scripture. So they promoted a stripped-down version of Christianity. \n\nQuakers also have a very simple form of worship, but they are a different group. The question might be looking for the Puritans as the answer. However, the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, I think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the Quakers are a different group, perhaps more associated with pacifism and simplicity in worship, but the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" is more commonly linked to the Puritans. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship and rejecting the ceremonial aspects of the Church of England. They were part of the Reformation, seeking to purify the church. Quakers, on the other hand, were a group that emerged later, in the 17th century, and they had a very different approach, with no formal clergy, and a focus on inner light. \n\nSo, which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity? The Puritans are more about simplifying the church's practices, while Quakers are about a different kind of simplicity. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might be more associated with the Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers. Wait, but the Puritans were a movement within the Church of England, but they were not a denomination. However, the question lists \"Puritans\" as an option, so perhaps that's acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. Because they are a denomination, and they have a very simple form of worship. \n\nBut I think the most accurate answer is (C) Puritans. Because they were known for their stripped-down approach, rejecting elaborate rituals. The Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but perhaps the answer is Puritans. \n\nWait, I think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the question is about a denomination, but Puritans were a movement, not a denomination. However, the options include Puritans as (C), so maybe that's the intended answer. Alternatively, Quakers are a denomination. \n\nWait, the question says \"denomination\". The Puritans were a group within the Church of England, but they formed their own congregations. So maybe they are considered a denomination. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be (D) Quakers, as they are a distinct denomination with a simple form of worship. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. Let me check my knowledge again. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity, rejecting the \"popish\" rituals, and they wanted to have a more direct, Bible-based worship. They are often associated with the idea of a stripped-down Christianity. Quakers, on the other hand, have a very different approach, with their own unique practices and beliefs. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely (C) Puritans.\n",
