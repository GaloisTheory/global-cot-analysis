  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They have a lot of sacraments, icons, and a strong emphasis on tradition and the Church's authority. So I don't think they are associated with a stripped-down version. They probably have a lot of ceremonies and formalities.\n\nRoman Catholicism is another major denomination. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a centralized structure with the Pope. They also have a lot of rituals and liturgical practices. So similar to Greek Orthodox, maybe not the stripped-down version either. But wait, there might be some differences. However, I think they are more elaborate compared to other groups.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within Protestantism in the 16th and 17th centuries. They were known for wanting to \"purify\" the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic remnants. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They focused on personal piety, scripture, and a more direct relationship with God. So this sounds like a stripped-down Christianity. They might have been more austere in their practices compared to the Catholic or Orthodox traditions.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They are known for their simplicity in worship, emphasizing the inner light and direct communication with God. They don't have a formal liturgy, and their meetings are often silent, with individuals speaking when moved by the Spirit. They also reject hierarchical structures and formal religious practices. So Quakers also have a stripped-down approach. \n\nWait, but the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. Both Puritans and Quakers might fit. But let me check the answer choices again. The options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more accurate?\n\nThe Puritans were a specific movement within Protestantism, particularly in England, and they were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, rejecting Catholic practices. They were more focused on reforming the Church of England from within, but they also had their own strict practices. However, Quakers took a more radical approach, rejecting even the structure of the Church and liturgical practices. \n\nBut maybe the question is looking for the Puritans as the answer. Let me think again. The term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to removing excessive rituals and focusing on the essentials. The Puritans were known for this. Quakers also had a stripped-down approach, but perhaps they are considered a separate denomination. However, the options are separate. \n\nWait, the answer choices are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. The question is which one promotes stripped-down Christianity. Both could be correct, but maybe the answer is Puritans. Alternatively, maybe the Quakers are more associated with simplicity. \n\nAlternatively, let me think about the historical context. The Puritans, especially in the 16th and 17th centuries, were known for their emphasis on a simplified form of worship, rejecting things like elaborate church ceremonies, music, and even the use of the Book of Common Prayer. They believed in a more direct, personal relationship with God based on scripture. \n\nQuakers, on the other hand, were even more radical. They rejected formal religious structures, liturgy, and even the concept of a clergy. Their meetings were silent, and they emphasized inner spiritual experience. They also had a more egalitarian approach. \n\nBut the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. Both could fit, but maybe the answer is Puritans. However, in some contexts, Quakers are also considered to have a stripped-down form. \n\nWait, the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Let me check some sources. The Puritans were a Protestant group that sought to purify the Church of England from Catholic practices, advocating for a simpler, more scriptural form of worship. Quakers, on the other hand, were a radical sect that rejected many traditional practices, including the use of clergy, liturgy, and formal worship. \n\nBut in terms of the answer, maybe the intended answer is Puritans. However, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the answer could be Quakers. \n\nWait, the question says \"denomination\". Quakers are a denomination. The Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, but they weren't a separate denomination. They were part of the Reformed tradition. However, some groups that emerged from Puritanism, like the Congregationalists, became denominations. But the Puritans themselves were more of a movement rather than a formal denomination. \n\nSo if the question is about a denomination, then Quakers (D) might be the answer. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is (D) Quakers because they are known for their simplicity. \n\nBut I need to recall. In some textbooks, the Puritans are often associated with a stripped-down Christianity. Quakers are also known for simplicity, but maybe the answer here is (C) Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is both, but since the options are separate, perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans. \n\nI think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because they were known for wanting to strip away the Catholic practices and simplify worship. Quakers are also known for simplicity, but maybe the answer is Puritans here. Let me check again. \n\nIn summary, the Puritans are more associated with stripping down the Church of England's practices, while Quakers are a different group. So the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
