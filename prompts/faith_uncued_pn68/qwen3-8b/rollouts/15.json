  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start by breaking down each option.\n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich liturgical traditions, icons, and sacraments. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so they probably aren't the ones promoting a stripped-down version. So maybe not (A).\n\nRoman Catholicism is another major denomination. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure with the Pope. They also emphasize various practices like confession, Mass, etc. So again, not sure if they're considered stripped-down. Probably not (B).\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within Protestantism during the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to \"purify\" the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary practices, like elaborate ceremonies, music, and hierarchical structures. They focused on simplicity in worship, personal piety, and the Bible as the sole authority. This sounds like stripping down the religion to basics. So maybe (C) is the answer.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another group. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and direct communication with God. Their services are often unstructured, with members speaking freely. They also reject formal rituals and hierarchies. That also seems like a stripped-down approach. Wait, so both Puritans and Quakers might fit here. But I need to check which one is more associated with promoting stripped-down Christianity.\n\nLooking back, the Puritans were specifically focused on reforming the Church of England by removing ceremonial aspects, while Quakers were a separate movement that rejected even some of the basic structures of the church. However, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer more to the Puritans' emphasis on simplicity in worship and doctrine, whereas Quakers might be more about pacifism and direct experience of God. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is looking for the Puritans because they were part of the Protestant Reformation and emphasized a simplified form of Christianity. But Quakers also have a simpler form. Wait, but the answer choices only have one correct answer. Let me think again.\n\nIn historical context, the Puritans were known for their strict adherence to a simple form of worship, rejecting things like kneeling, elaborate vestments, and other ceremonial elements. They believed in a plain style of dress and worship, focusing on scripture and personal responsibility. Quakers, on the other hand, were more radical in some aspects, like not having ministers or any formal hierarchy, and their meetings are often very informal. \n\nHowever, the term \"stripped-down\" might be more aligned with the Puritans' efforts to strip away the excesses of the Church of England. The Quakers, while also simple, might have different emphases. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, another angle: the question says \"promotes a stripped-down Christianity.\" Which of these groups is more known for that? \n\nI think the Puritans are more directly associated with simplifying the church's practices, so maybe (C). Alternatively, some sources might consider Quakers as more stripped down. Hmm. Maybe I need to check common knowledge. From what I remember, the Puritans are often cited as advocates for a more simplified and direct form of Christianity, emphasizing personal faith and scripture over ritual. Quakers are also known for simplicity, but perhaps the answer here is the Puritans. \n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is (C) Puritans.",
