  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by breaking down each option.\n\nGreek Orthodox: I know that the Greek Orthodox Church is part of the Eastern Orthodox tradition. They have a rich liturgical tradition, with a lot of rituals, icons, and a hierarchical structure. They emphasize tradition and the sacraments. So they might not be the ones promoting a stripped-down version.\n\nRoman Catholic: The Roman Catholic Church is one of the largest Christian denominations. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a complex structure with the Pope. They also have a lot of rituals and dogmas. So I don't think they are known for being stripped-down either.\n\nPuritans: Now, the Puritans were a group within the 16th and 17th century Protestant movement. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They focused on personal faith, the Bible, and a more direct relationship with God. This sounds like a stripped-down version of Christianity, focusing on essentials and rejecting excess.\n\nQuakers: The Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their emphasis on the inner light and direct communion with God. They don't have a formal clergy, and their worship is often unstructured. They also promote simplicity in lifestyle and worship. However, I need to compare them with Puritans. Quakers were also part of the Protestant Reformation but had different practices. They might be considered more radical in some aspects, but the question is about stripped-down Christianity. Both Puritans and Quakers could be contenders here.\n\nWait, but the question is about which denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. Let me think again. The Puritans were specifically focused on simplifying worship and removing what they considered unnecessary elements from the Church of England. They were against things like elaborate rituals, ornate churches, and hierarchical structures. Their emphasis was on the Word of God and personal piety. Quakers, while also simple in worship, were more about the inner light and didn't have the same focus on purifying the Church structure. \n\nBut the answer choices are single options. So between Puritans and Quakers. Which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity? The Puritans are often seen as a movement that sought to simplify the Church's practices, whereas Quakers were a different group with their own distinct practices. However, some sources might list Quakers as promoting simplicity. Wait, but the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might align more with the Puritans. \n\nI think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the Puritans were specifically known for their emphasis on a simplified, more direct form of worship and rejecting the ceremonial aspects of the Church. Quakers, while also simple, were more about the inner light and less about stripping down the Church's practices. So the answer is likely (C).\n",
