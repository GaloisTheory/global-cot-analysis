  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on icons and sacraments. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nRoman Catholicism is another major denomination. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure with the Pope. They also have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so I don't think they're the answer either. \n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Anglican Church in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church of what they saw as unnecessary practices, like elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They emphasized simplicity in worship, a direct relationship with God, and the authority of the Bible. So they might be considered as promoting a stripped-down version of Christianity, focusing on basics like personal faith and scripture.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, also emphasize simplicity. They have a lot of plain dress, minimal rituals, and a focus on inner light and direct communion with God. They don't have a structured hierarchy and their meetings are often unprogrammed. So Quakers also might fit the description of stripped-down Christianity. \n\nWait, but the question is about a denomination. Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, not a denomination themselves. However, they did form their own congregations. Quakers are a distinct denomination. So maybe the answer is Quakers? But I need to check more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, the Puritans are often considered as promoting a stripped-down form of Christianity, rejecting the elaborate practices of the Church of England. They focused on personal piety, simplicity, and a more direct approach to faith. So even though they were a movement, they might be the answer here. However, the options are given as denominations, so Puritans as a denomination? Or are they considered part of the broader Protestant movement?\n\nWait, the answer choices are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. The question says \"denomination\", so Puritans were a movement, but Quakers are a denomination. However, sometimes Puritans are considered a denomination. But I think the key here is that the Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity. Quakers are also known for simplicity. \n\nBut maybe the answer is Puritans because they were more focused on stripping away rituals. Let me think again. The Puritans were part of the Reformation and wanted to purify the church, remove Catholic practices, and focus on the Bible. They were known for their plain dress, simple worship, and rejecting elaborate ceremonies. Quakers also have similar traits, but Quakers are a different group. \n\nThe question might be looking for the Puritans. However, if the options are denominations, then Quakers are a denomination. But I need to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check some key points. \n\nPuritans: Emphasized simplicity, rejected elaborate rituals, focused on personal Bible study, and inner spirituality. Their form of Christianity was stripped down compared to the Catholic and Anglican traditions. \n\nQuakers: Also emphasize simplicity, but they don't have a formal structure, and their meetings are unprogrammed. They are known for their pacifism and simplicity. \n\nBut the question is about a denomination. So if the answer choices include Puritans and Quakers, then which is more accurate? The Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, but they did form their own congregations. However, Quakers are a distinct denomination. \n\nBut maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" is often associated with the Puritans. Alternatively, Quakers might be considered as well. \n\nWait, the question is in the context of denominations. The Puritans were not a single denomination but a movement. However, in some contexts, they are referred to as a denomination. Alternatively, the answer might be (D) Quakers, as they are a distinct denomination with a simple form of worship. \n\nI think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the term \"stripped-down\" is often linked to the Puritans' emphasis on simplicity and rejecting unnecessary rituals. Quakers also have that, but maybe the Puritans are more associated with that concept. So the answer would be (C).\n",
