  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by considering each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on icons and sacraments. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so I don't think they are the ones promoting a stripped-down version. So probably not (A).\n\nRoman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a structured hierarchy. While there might be some groups within Catholicism that are more simplified, the denomination as a whole isn't known for being stripped down. So (B) might not be the answer either.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They promoted a more direct relationship with God, focusing on personal faith and Scripture. This sounds like \"stripped-down\" Christianity. So (C) could be the answer.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, are another Protestant group. They are known for their simplicity in worship, not using formal rituals, and emphasizing the inner light of God. They also have a more informal structure compared to other denominations. However, I need to compare them with the Puritans. The question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. Both Puritans and Quakers have elements of simplicity, but the Puritans were more focused on reforming the Church, whereas Quakers were a separate movement. However, I think the Puritans are more associated with the stripped-down approach. Wait, but Quakers also emphasize simplicity. Maybe the answer depends on which one is more known for that.\n\nWait, the Puritans were part of the Reformation and were known for their emphasis on a simplified, Bible-centered worship. They rejected the elaborate rituals of the Catholic Church and even some practices of the Anglican Church. They believed in a more personal and direct relationship with God, which aligns with a stripped-down approach. Quakers also have a similar focus on simplicity, but they might be considered a different movement. However, the question is about denominations. The Puritans are a group within Protestantism, but they weren't a single denomination. However, the options include (C) Puritans. So perhaps the answer is (C). Alternatively, Quakers might be considered as promoting stripped-down Christianity. But I think the Puritans are more associated with that. Let me check again. The Quakers did have a very simple form of worship, no formal clergy, and emphasized inner light. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might be more associated with the Puritans. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, but the question is about denominations. The Puritans were a movement within the Church of England, but they didn't form a separate denomination. However, in the options given, (C) is Puritans. So maybe the answer is (C). Alternatively, Quakers are a denomination. So which one is more correct? \n\nI think the Puritans are more known for promoting a stripped-down Christianity. They rejected the elaborate rituals and focused on the Bible. Quakers also have simplicity, but perhaps the Puritans are the answer here. So I think the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
