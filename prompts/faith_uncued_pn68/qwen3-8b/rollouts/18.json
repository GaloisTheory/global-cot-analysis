  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They are known for their rich rituals, icons, and liturgical traditions. They have a lot of sacraments and maintain a lot of traditions from the early church. So I don't think they're the ones promoting a stripped-down version.\n\nNext, the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They also have a lot of rituals and ceremonies. So again, not the stripped-down version. They might be more elaborate than some other denominations.\n\nThen there are the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Anglican Church in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church of what they saw as unnecessary practices, like elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, focusing on the Bible and personal faith. So they might fit the description of a stripped-down Christianity.\n\nQuakers, on the other hand, are another group. They are known for their simplicity in worship, not using formal prayers or set rituals. They emphasize inner spiritual experience and direct communication with God. They also reject many traditional church practices. So Quakers are also known for simplicity.\n\nWait, so both Puritans and Quakers might be candidates here. But the question is asking for a denomination. Quakers are a denomination, and Puritans were a movement within the Anglican Church, but they also formed their own congregations. However, the term \"denomination\" might be more accurate for Quakers. But I need to check which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity.\n\nPuritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies and focusing on the Word of God. Quakers also emphasize simplicity, but they are more known for their lack of formal structure and their emphasis on the \"inner light.\" \n\nHowever, the answer choices are given as (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. The question is which one promotes stripped-down Christianity. Both have elements of that, but maybe the Puritans are more associated with stripping down the Church's practices. Alternatively, Quakers might be considered more extreme in their simplicity. \n\nWait, but the options are A, B, C, D. The answer might be (C) Puritans. However, I should verify. Let me think again. The Puritans were a Protestant movement that wanted to purify the church, so they were against the Catholic practices, but they were not as extreme as Quakers. Quakers, being a separate denomination, have a more radical approach. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might refer to removing unnecessary elements. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers because they are known for their simple worship and lack of formal structure. But I need to be sure. \n\nWait, the question says \"denomination.\" The Puritans were not a single denomination but a movement. However, some Puritan groups did form their own denominations. Quakers are a denomination. So perhaps the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Let me check. The Puritans were part of the Reformation, seeking to simplify the Church's practices. Quakers are a separate group that also emphasized simplicity. However, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more accurately applied to the Puritans because they were part of the Protestant Reformation and focused on simplifying the Church's rituals. But Quakers are also known for their simplicity. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the Puritans are often associated with the idea of \"stripping down\" the church's practices, such as removing the episcopal structure and emphasizing the sermon as the central part of worship. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is (C) Puritans. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe (D) Quakers. Let me think again. The Quakers are known for their simplicity, but they also have a different structure. However, the question is about a denomination. The Puritans might be considered a movement rather than a denomination. But the answer choices include (C) Puritans. \n\nWait, the question says \"denomination.\" The Puritans were not a denomination but a movement. However, some Puritan groups did form denominations. The Quakers are a denomination. So if the question is looking for a denomination, then (D) Quakers might be the answer. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Because they are part of the Protestant tradition and their emphasis on simplicity. \n\nI need to recall that the Puritans are often associated with the idea of a \"stripped-down\" Christianity. They wanted to remove the excesses of the Church of England, focusing on a simpler form of worship. Quakers, however, are more known for their unique practices, such as not having a formal clergy, and their meetings for worship. \n\nBut the question is which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. So between Puritans and Quakers. I think the answer is (C) Puritans. However, I'm not entirely certain. But given the options, I think (C) is more likely.\n",
