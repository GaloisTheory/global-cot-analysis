  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They are known for their rich traditions, liturgical practices, icons, and a lot of sacraments. They have a complex structure with a lot of rituals, so I don't think they would be considered stripped-down.\n\nThen there's the Roman Catholic Church. They also have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies. So maybe not the stripped-down version either. Although there are some movements within Catholicism that might be more simplified, the denomination as a whole is more traditional and elaborate.\n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in the 16th and 17th centuries who wanted to \"purify\" the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing on personal faith and the Bible. They believed in a more direct relationship with God, without the need for intermediaries like priests. So this seems like they might be promoting a stripped-down Christianity, removing the extra ceremonies and focusing on the essentials.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They are known for their simplicity in worship, not having a formal structure, and emphasizing the inner light of the Holy Spirit. They don't have a clergy, and their meetings are often very quiet and unstructured. This also sounds like a stripped-down approach, but I need to compare them with the Puritans.\n\nWait, the question is about a denomination. Puritans were a movement within the Church of England, but they eventually formed their own churches. Quakers are a separate denomination. So both Puritans and Quakers are considered to have simpler practices. But which one is more known for stripping down Christianity?\n\nThe Puritans were more focused on simplifying the Church of England's practices, removing things like elaborate vestments, rituals, and ceremonies. They wanted a more direct, Bible-based worship. Quakers take it even further by not having any formal rituals at all, no set order of service, and no clergy. But perhaps the term \"stripped-down\" might be more commonly associated with the Puritans because they were part of a larger movement to reform and simplify the church structure. However, Quakers are also known for their simplicity.\n\nBut the answer choices are only four. Let me think again. The question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans are a denomination (though they were a movement within Anglicanism), but Quakers are a separate denomination. The Puritans emphasized simplicity in worship, so maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, Quakers are known for their simplicity. But which one is more correct?\n\nWait, the term \"stripped-down\" might refer to the Puritans' emphasis on removing all unnecessary elements of worship, like the use of elaborate church services, vestments, and rituals. They sought to return to the \"pure\" practices of the early church, hence the name \"Puritans.\" Quakers, on the other hand, are more about inner spirituality and not having any formal structure. But perhaps the answer is Puritans. Alternatively, Quakers are also considered to have a stripped-down approach. \n\nLooking up some key points: Puritans were known for their emphasis on personal piety, simplicity of worship, and the rejection of Catholic practices. Quakers are known for their unstructured meetings, lack of formal rituals, and emphasis on the inner light. Both are stripped down, but which one is more correct here?\n\nThe question says \"denomination,\" so Quakers are a denomination. Puritans were a movement, but they did form their own congregations. However, the answer choices include (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. If the question is about a denomination, then Quakers are a denomination, and Puritans might be considered a movement. However, some sources might refer to the Puritans as a denomination. But perhaps the answer intended here is (C) Puritans because they are more associated with stripping down the practices of the Church of England. Alternatively, maybe (D) Quakers.\n\nWait, another angle: the term \"stripped-down\" could refer to minimalism. Quakers have no set form of worship, no clergy, no set order of service, which is more extreme. Puritans were more about simplifying the liturgy and removing Catholic elements. But which one is considered the correct answer here?\n\nI think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the Puritans are known for their emphasis on a simplified form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals, and focusing on the Bible. Quakers are also known for simplicity, but perhaps the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" is more directly associated with the Puritans. Alternatively, maybe Quakers are considered more stripped down. \n\nBut I need to recall that the Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation, seeking to purify the Church of England. They wanted to remove all the Catholic practices, leading to a simpler form of worship. So their approach was to strip away the excesses of the Catholic Church, which aligns with the idea of stripped-down Christianity. Therefore, the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
