  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They are known for their rich traditions, liturgical practices, and the use of icons. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so probably not the stripped-down version.\n\nNext, the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of sacraments, a hierarchical structure, and various traditions. While there are some reform movements within Catholicism, like the Jesuits or certain modernist approaches, the mainstream Roman Catholic Church isn't typically described as stripped-down. They have a comprehensive set of practices and doctrines.\n\nThen there are the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Anglican Church in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church of what they saw as unnecessary rituals and practices, aiming for a more simple and direct form of worship. They emphasized the Bible, personal piety, and a more austere lifestyle. This sounds like a stripped-down Christianity, focusing on essentials without the elaborate traditions.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, have a different approach. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and direct communication with God. They don't have a formal clergy, and their worship is often unstructured. However, Quakers are more about spiritual equality and pacifism rather than necessarily a stripped-down version of Christianity. Their practices are more about simplicity in worship, but I'm not sure if they are considered the most \"stripped-down\" compared to the Puritans.\n\nComparing the two, the Puritans were specifically focused on simplifying church practices, removing what they saw as excesses, and returning to the basics of the faith. Quakers also have a simple approach, but the question is about a denomination. The Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, so they form a denomination. Quakers are a separate denomination. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might align more with the Puritans' emphasis on simplicity and rejecting traditions. \n\nWait, but I should check if any of the other options might fit better. Greek Orthodox is the opposite. Roman Catholic is not stripped down. Quakers are more about simplicity in worship but not necessarily stripping down the faith's structure. The Puritans were known for their Calvinist theology and emphasis on a plain, simple form of worship. So I think the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
