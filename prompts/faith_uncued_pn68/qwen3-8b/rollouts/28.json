  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical ceremonies, and emphasis on icons, sacraments, and the veneration of saints. They have a lot of rituals and a complex structure, so I don't think they're the answer here because \"stripped-down\" implies simplicity.\n\nRoman Catholicism also has a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure with the Pope. They have a comprehensive set of practices, so again, not the most likely candidate for stripped-down Christianity.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the 16th and 17th century Protestant movement. They wanted to \"purify\" the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary rituals and ceremonies. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, focusing on the Bible, personal faith, and a direct relationship with God. This seems to align with the idea of stripping away excess, so they might be the answer.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, emphasize personal revelation and inner light. They have a very simple worship style, often without formal clergy or set rituals. Their meetings are usually quiet and focused on silent contemplation. This also fits the idea of a stripped-down approach. But wait, how does that compare to the Puritans?\n\nWait, the question is about denominations. The Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, but they weren't a separate denomination. They were more of a group within the Church of England that wanted to reform it. However, some Puritan groups did form their own congregations. Quakers, on the other hand, are a distinct denomination that emerged in the 17th century. \n\nSo, the question is which of these options is the correct answer. The key here is the term \"stripped-down Christianity.\" Puritans wanted to remove what they considered unnecessary elements from the Church of England, like elaborate rituals, which would make their form of Christianity simpler. Quakers, being even more minimalist, might also fit. But in terms of historical context, the Puritans are more associated with the Reformation and simplifying worship, while the Quakers are known for their simplicity in worship and rejection of formal structures. \n\nBut the answer choices are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. The question is which one promotes a stripped-down Christianity. Let me think again. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, rejecting things like elaborate church ceremonies, and focusing on the Bible and personal faith. Quakers also have a very simple form of worship, but they are a different denomination. However, the question might be looking for the Puritans as the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Quakers are considered more stripped-down because they don't have clergy, no set rituals, and their meetings are very simple. But I think the Puritans are more directly associated with the idea of stripping down the Church of England's practices. However, the Puritans were not a denomination but a movement. Wait, but in the answer choices, Puritans are listed as an option. So perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans. \n\nBut I need to be careful. The Quakers are a distinct denomination that started in the 17th century, and they emphasized simplicity. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might be more associated with the Puritans. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers. \n\nWait, looking up some key points: The Puritans were known for their desire to purify the Church of England by removing Catholic practices, leading to a simpler form of worship. Quakers are known for their simplicity in worship, no formal hierarchy, and direct communion with God. But which one is more about stripping down? The question is about a denomination. The Puritans might be considered a denomination, but actually, they were a movement within the Church of England. However, the answer options include Puritans as (C). \n\nAlternatively, the Quakers are a denomination. So which one is more correct? \n\nIn some sources, the Puritans are often cited as promoting a simplified form of Christianity, focusing on the Bible and personal faith, while rejecting elaborate rituals. Quakers also have a very stripped-down approach. But in the context of the options given, the answer is likely (C) Puritans. However, I need to verify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. Let me think of key characteristics. The Puritans were more about reforming the Church of England, while Quakers were a separate group. But the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. If the Puritans are considered a denomination, then (C) would be the answer. However, the Puritans are often seen as a movement rather than a formal denomination. \n\nBut the options are given, and (C) is an option. So perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, another angle: The term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to a very minimalistic form. The Quakers have no clergy, no set prayers, and their meetings are very simple. So they might be considered more stripped down. But the Puritans also had a simpler form. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, in historical context, the Puritans are more commonly associated with the idea of stripping away Catholic practices and simplifying worship. Therefore, the answer is likely (C) Puritans. However, I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, some sources might say Quakers. \n\nBut given the options, and the fact that the Puritans are a movement that sought to simplify Christianity, I think the answer is (C). But I need to check again. \n\nAnother thought: The Quakers are known for their simplicity in worship, but they are a distinct denomination. The Puritans, while a movement, are sometimes grouped as a denomination. However, in some contexts, the answer could be (D). \n\nHmm. Maybe I should consider that the Quakers are more about simplicity in worship, while the Puritans were more about reforming the Church of England. The question is about promoting stripped-down Christianity. The term \"stripped-down\" could be interpreted as minimalism. Both could fit, but which is more correct? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans because they are more directly associated with the idea of stripping away excess. Therefore, the best answer is (C).\n",
