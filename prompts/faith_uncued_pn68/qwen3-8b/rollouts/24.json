  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations believes and practices. Let me start by breaking down each option.\n\nGreek Orthodox: They are part of the Eastern Orthodox tradition. They have a lot of rituals, icons, liturgical services, and emphasize tradition, mysticism, and the role of the Church. They don't really practice a stripped-down version; instead, they have a rich ceremonial life. So maybe not the answer.\n\nRoman Catholic: The Roman Catholic Church has a lot of sacraments, hierarchical structure, and traditions. They also have a lot of rituals and ceremonies. While there might be some variations in how strict or lenient certain practices are, I don't think they're known for being stripped-down. They have a comprehensive system of beliefs and practices.\n\nPuritans: Now, the Puritans were a group within the 16th and 17th century Protestant movement. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as excessive practices and rituals. They emphasized simplicity in worship, strict adherence to the Bible, and a focus on personal piety. This sounds like \"stripped-down\" Christianity because they rejected elaborate ceremonies, focused on scripture, and had a more austere lifestyle. So this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nQuakers: The Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, are known for their simple worship practices, emphasis on inner light, and rejection of formal religious structures. They don't use clergy, have no set liturgy, and meet in meetings where people speak freely. Their approach is very minimalist and direct, focusing on personal spiritual experience rather than rituals. This also fits the idea of stripped-down Christianity.\n\nWait, so both Puritans and Quakers seem to fit. But maybe the question is looking for the most accurate answer. Let me think again.\n\nThe term \"stripped-down\" could refer to minimalism in rituals and practices. Puritans were more about reforming the Church of England, emphasizing simplicity, but they still had some structure. Quakers, on the other hand, are even more radical in their simplicity. They don't have a hierarchy, no clergy, and their meetings are very unstructured. However, the question mentions \"denomination,\" and Quakers are considered a denomination, while Puritans were a movement that led to the formation of various groups, including Congregationalists. \n\nBut perhaps the key here is that Puritans specifically promoted a stripped-down form of Christianity. They rejected things like elaborate church music, vestments, and other ceremonial aspects. Their goal was to simplify worship to focus on the Word of God. Quakers also have a stripped-down approach, but maybe the question is pointing towards Puritans as the correct answer. Alternatively, the Quakers might be considered more extreme in that aspect.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the answer choices, maybe the intended answer is (C) Puritans. Because when people refer to \"stripped-down\" Christianity, the Puritans are often cited for their emphasis on simplicity, plainness, and rejecting excesses. Quakers are also correct, but perhaps the answer depends on historical context. \n\nAnother angle: the Puritans were a specific movement within Protestantism that sought to purify the Church of England, advocating for a simpler form of worship. Quakers emerged later and had different practices. Since the question lists them as separate options, it's possible that the answer is either C or D. \n\nBut I need to check if any of these denominations are more associated with stripped-down Christianity. For example, the Quakers' meetings are very simple, with no formal rituals. However, the Puritans are known for their emphasis on simplicity in religious practice. \n\nIn some textbooks, the Puritans are often highlighted as promoting a stripped-down Christianity, focusing on the Bible and rejecting unnecessary rituals. Therefore, the answer might be (C). \n\nBut I'm a bit conflicted between C and D. Let me verify. The Quakers, as a denomination, definitely have a stripped-down approach. However, the question may be referring to the Puritans as the primary answer. Maybe the answer is (C) Puritans.",
