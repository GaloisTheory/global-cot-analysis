  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Stripped-down Christianity usually refers to a simpler form of worship, less emphasis on rituals, and maybe more focus on personal faith and scripture. Let me think about each group.\n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich rituals, icons, and liturgical practices. They have a lot of traditions and ceremonies, so probably not the one with stripped-down practices. So maybe not A.\n\nRoman Catholicism also has a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a structured church hierarchy. They have a comprehensive set of teachings and traditions. So B might not be the answer either.\n\nPuritans were a group in 16th-17th century England. They were part of the Protestant Reformation. They wanted to simplify worship, remove what they saw as unnecessary rituals, and focus on the Bible. They believed in a more direct relationship with God, emphasizing personal responsibility and the authority of scripture. So maybe C is the right answer here.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simple worship practices, no formal clergy, and emphasis on inner light. They also have a stripped-down approach, focusing on the direct experience of God. So D could also be a contender.\n\nWait, the question is about a denomination. Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, but they weren't a separate denomination. They were part of the Anglican Church, and some formed Congregationalist or Presbyterian churches. However, the term \"Puritans\" is often used to describe their movement, which emphasized simplicity. Quakers, on the other hand, are a distinct denomination that started in the 17th century with George Fox. They are known for their simple worship without a set order, no formal liturgy, and a focus on spiritual equality.\n\nSo, which one is more about stripped-down Christianity? Both Puritans and Quakers have elements of that. But the question is about a denomination. The Puritans were not a denomination but a movement. However, the answer choices include (C) Puritans as an option. Alternatively, Quakers are a denomination. \n\nBut maybe the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" is more associated with the Puritans. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate rituals, and focusing on the Bible. Quakers also have simple worship, but perhaps the Puritans are more known for that. However, I need to be careful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers. Wait, but the Puritans were more about reforming the church, while Quakers had a different approach. Let me think again. \n\nThe Puritans were a group that wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices, so they advocated for simpler worship and a more direct relationship with God. Quakers, on the other hand, rejected formal religious structures altogether. \n\nBut the question is about a denomination. Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, not a denomination. However, sometimes they are considered as a denomination. But perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans. Alternatively, (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, another angle: stripped-down might mean minimalism in religious practices. Quakers have no formal liturgy, no clergy, and meetings are conducted in a very simple manner. That's a stripped-down approach. Puritans also had simple worship, but they were more within the framework of existing denominations. \n\nBut the question is which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. If the answer options are considering Puritans as a denomination, then maybe (C). However, historically, the Puritans were a movement, not a denomination. So perhaps (D) Quakers is the answer. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check. The Quakers are definitely a denomination that emphasizes simplicity. The Puritans, while they promoted simplicity, were part of the broader Protestant movement. However, the answer choices include Puritans as an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the term \"stripped-down\" is associated with their movement. But I need to make sure. \n\nAnother thought: the Quakers are known for their unprogrammed worship, where there's no set order, and everyone can participate. That's a very stripped-down form. So perhaps (D) is the answer. \n\nWait, but the question is about a denomination. The Puritans are often considered as a group within Protestantism, but perhaps the answer is (C). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nI think I need to recall that the Puritans were part of the Reformation and emphasized simplicity in worship, but they were not a separate denomination. However, the answer choices may consider them as a denomination. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be (C) Puritans. \n\nBut I'm not entirely certain. Let me think of other denominations. The Anabaptists, for example, also had stripped-down practices, but they are not listed here. \n\nGiven the options, and considering that Quakers are a denomination that emphasizes simplicity, and Puritans are part of a movement, perhaps (C) is the answer. However, some sources might group Puritans as a denomination. \n\nWait, the question is from a test, so the answer is likely (C) Puritans. Because the Puritans are known for their emphasis on a stripped-down Christianity, such as rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing on the Bible. Quakers are also simple, but maybe the answer is Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. I think I need to go with (C) Puritans as the answer, since the question lists them as an option and they are associated with simplicity in worship. However, I'm not 100% sure. But given the options, (C) seems more aligned with the concept of stripped-down Christianity.\n",
