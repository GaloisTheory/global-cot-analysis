  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start by thinking about each one.\n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on icons, sacraments, and the veneration of saints. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so I don't think they're about stripping things down. So maybe not A.\n\nRoman Catholicism also has a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a structured church hierarchy. They have a lot of rituals and liturgical practices. So B might not be the answer either. Although they do have some variations, like the Catholic Church having different practices in various regions, but generally, they are not known for being stripped down.\n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in England during the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary rituals and traditions. They believed in a simpler form of worship, emphasizing the Bible, personal faith, and a direct relationship with God. They rejected elaborate ceremonies and focused on a more austere, stripped-down Christianity. So maybe C is the answer.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, are another group. They emphasize inner light, personal revelation, and simplicity. They don't have formal rituals like sacraments or a structured hierarchy. Their meetings are often quiet and unstructured. But I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination in the same way as the others. Wait, the question says \"denomination,\" so Quakers are a denomination. However, their approach is more about simplicity and direct experience of God, which could be seen as stripped down. But comparing to Puritans, the Puritans were more focused on reforming the Church of England, whereas Quakers were a separate movement that rejected many traditional church structures.\n\nSo which one is more about stripped-down Christianity? The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies and focusing on the essentials of the faith. Quakers also have a stripped-down approach, but maybe the Puritans are more associated with that term. The question might be looking for the Puritans as the answer. Let me check again. The Puritans were part of the Reformation, advocating for a more simplified Christian practice, so their movement aimed to strip away what they considered unnecessary elements of the Church. So C is Puritans. Quakers are also a movement that values simplicity, but perhaps the Puritans are more directly associated with promoting a stripped-down version of Christianity. Therefore, the answer is C.\n",
