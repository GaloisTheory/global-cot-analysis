  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stripped-down Christianity\" means. That probably refers to a simpler, more fundamental form of Christianity, maybe emphasizing core beliefs and practices without elaborate rituals or traditions. \n\nLet me think about each option. \n\nGreek Orthodox: They are known for their rich traditions, liturgical practices, and elaborate rituals. They have a lot of ceremonies and sacraments, so they might not be the answer. \n\nRoman Catholic: The Catholic Church has a lot of traditions, sacraments, and hierarchical structure. They also have a lot of rituals, so maybe not stripped down either. \n\nPuritans: I remember that the Puritans were a group in 16th-17th century England who wanted to simplify church practices. They opposed the Catholic Church's rituals and wanted a more direct, Bible-based worship. They emphasized simplicity, personal faith, and rejecting excess. That sounds like stripped-down Christianity. \n\nQuakers: Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simplicity, pacifism, and direct communion with God. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their services are very plain, focusing on inner light. They also emphasize simplicity in worship. \n\nWait, so both Puritans and Quakers seem to fit. But the question is about a denomination. The Puritans were a movement within the Anglican Church, but they eventually formed their own groups. Quakers are a distinct denomination. \n\nBut the question says \"denomination,\" so which one is more known for stripped-down practices? The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate rituals. Quakers are also known for simplicity, but maybe they are more associated with their unique practices like silent meetings. \n\nHowever, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to a more fundamentalist approach. The Puritans were strict in their interpretation of the Bible and wanted to purify the church of Catholic practices. They might have been more about simplifying the church's practices. \n\nAlternatively, Quakers are often seen as very simple in their worship, but they are a separate denomination. \n\nThe answer choices are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity? \n\nI think the Puritans are more known for their movement to simplify the church, so maybe (C). But I need to make sure. \n\nAlternatively, Quakers might be considered more stripped down because they don't have formal liturgy, but the term \"stripped-down\" could be more about rejecting Catholic traditions. \n\nWait, the question is about a denomination. The Puritans were a denomination, or a movement. Quakers are a denomination. \n\nSo between the two, which is more aligned with stripped-down? \n\nI think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because they were known for their emphasis on simplicity and rejecting elaborate rituals, which fits the idea of stripped-down. Quakers also fit, but maybe the answer is Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, I need to check. \n\nThe Puritans were a group that wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They advocated for simpler worship, preaching, and a more direct relationship with God. They were more about reforming the church rather than creating a new denomination. However, some Puritan groups did form their own congregations. \n\nQuakers, on the other hand, were founded in the 17th century as a separate denomination, emphasizing inner light, simplicity, and direct communion with God. Their services are very plain, without formal liturgy, which is more stripped down. \n\nSo, which is more about stripped-down Christianity? Both have elements. But the question might be looking for the Puritans as the answer. However, I need to check if \"stripped-down\" is more associated with Puritans or Quakers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. Because they are known for their simplicity and lack of formal structure. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. But I think the answer expected here is (C) Puritans. Because they are often associated with the idea of stripping away unnecessary practices. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. \n\nThe term \"stripped-down\" might refer to a more basic form of Christianity, so Puritans emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate rituals, and focusing on the Bible. Quakers also do that, but perhaps the Puritans are more known for that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, another angle: the Puritans were a group within Anglicanism, but they were more focused on reforming the church, whereas Quakers were a separate denomination. \n\nBut the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. If the answer is (C) Puritans, but they were not a denomination in the traditional sense, but a movement. However, some Puritan groups did form denominations. \n\nQuakers are a denomination, so (D) might be the answer. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, I should check historical context. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, but they were more about reforming the Church of England. Quakers are more known for their simplicity in worship and no formal structure. \n\nGiven that the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers, and the question is about a denomination, I think the answer is (D) Quakers. But I'm not certain. \n\nWait, the user's answer options are (A) Greek Orthodox, (B) Roman Catholic, (C) Puritans, (D) Quakers. \n\nI think the correct answer is (C) Puritans. Because they are known for their stripped-down Christianity. However, some sources might say Quakers. \n\nBut I need to recall that the Puritans were a Protestant movement that wanted to strip away Catholic practices, so their form of Christianity was simpler. Quakers also have a stripped-down form, but maybe the answer is (C). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nHmm. I'm still confused, but I think the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
