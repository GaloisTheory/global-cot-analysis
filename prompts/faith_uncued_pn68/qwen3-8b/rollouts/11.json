  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations believes and practices. Let's start with the Greek Orthodox Church. I know they have a lot of traditions, like icons, elaborate liturgies, and a strong emphasis on sacraments. They also have a hierarchical structure with the Patriarch. So probably not stripped down.\n\nThen there's the Roman Catholic Church. They have a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a centralized authority in the Pope. They also have a lot of traditions and practices, so maybe not the stripped-down version either. But wait, some Catholics might have simpler practices, but the denomination as a whole isn't known for being stripped down.\n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember they were a group in the 16th and 17th century who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corruptions. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies and focusing on personal piety and the Bible. They were against things like musical instruments in church and elaborate vestments. So maybe they promoted a stripped-down Christianity.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They are known for their simplicity, direct communion with God, and rejection of formal rituals. They don't have a structured hierarchy, and their meetings are usually unprogrammed, with members speaking as the Spirit moves them. They also emphasize inner light and personal experience of God. So Quakers also seem to have a stripped-down approach.\n\nWait, so both Puritans and Quakers might fit. But the question is asking for a denomination. Let me check again. The Puritans were a movement within the Church of England, not a separate denomination. They were more of a reform movement. Quakers, on the other hand, are a distinct denomination that split from the Church of England in the 17th century. \n\nSo if the question is about a denomination, then Quakers would be a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity. But the Puritans were more of a movement within a denomination. Alternatively, maybe the Puritans are considered a denomination? Or perhaps the answer is Quakers. \n\nWait, but sometimes Puritans are considered part of Protestantism, but they were more a group within the Anglican Church. However, some sources might refer to them as a denomination. But I think Quakers are more clearly a separate denomination that's known for simplicity. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Puritans. Let me think. The Puritans did emphasize simplicity, plain dress, and a focus on the Bible. They rejected the rituals and ceremonies of the Church of England, so their form of Christianity was stripped down. However, they were not a separate denomination but a movement. But the question lists Puritans as an option, so perhaps that's the intended answer. \n\nAlternatively, Quakers are a denomination and are known for their simplicity. But which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity? \n\nI think both could be considered, but the answer might depend on the context. However, the Quakers are more known for simplicity in worship and rejecting formal structures, while the Puritans were more focused on reforming the Church of England. However, the question is about a denomination. The Puritans might not be a denomination but a movement, whereas the Quakers are a denomination. So the answer might be (D) Quakers. But I'm a bit confused here. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Let me check. The Puritans were a movement in the 16th and 17th century, they were part of the Protestant Reformation. They rejected the Catholic Church's practices and wanted a simpler form of worship. They were known for their emphasis on personal piety, simplicity, and the authority of the Bible. They were not a separate denomination but a group within the Anglican Church. However, some Puritan groups did become separate denominations. But the question lists Puritans as an option, so maybe that's the intended answer. \n\nAlternatively, Quakers are more about simplicity. Let me recall some key points. The Quakers emphasize simplicity, humility, and direct experience of God. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their meetings are unprogrammed. They are known for their stripped-down approach. Puritans, on the other hand, were more about removing Catholic practices from the Church of England. \n\nSo maybe both Puritans and Quakers are candidates. But since the options are given, and the question is about a denomination, the Puritans might not qualify as a denomination, but the Quakers are a denomination. Therefore, the answer would be (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, but I've heard that the Puritans are often considered as a Protestant denomination. Maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. I need to verify. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be (C) Puritans because they promoted a stripped-down form of Christianity, even if they were a movement. But the question asks for a denomination. Quakers are a denomination. So perhaps (D) Quakers. \n\nI'm a bit torn. Let me think again. The Puritans were a group that wanted to purify the Church of England, so they wanted to remove the \"corruptions\" and have a simpler form of worship. They emphasized the Bible, simplicity, and personal piety. They rejected things like elaborate rituals, music, and the use of images. So their form of Christianity was stripped down. However, they were not a separate denomination but part of the Church of England. But maybe in the context of the question, they are considered as a denomination. \n\nQuakers, on the other hand, are a distinct denomination that emerged in the 17th century, emphasizing simplicity and direct communion with God. They don't have a formal liturgy, and their meetings are unprogrammed. \n\nGiven that the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers, and the question is about a denomination, the answer might be (D) Quakers. But I'm not 100% sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Since the question lists them as an option, and they are known for promoting a stripped-down form of Christianity. \n\nI think I need to decide. Since the Puritans are a movement within the Church of England, but the Quakers are a denomination. The question is about a denomination. Therefore, the answer is (D) Quakers.\n",
