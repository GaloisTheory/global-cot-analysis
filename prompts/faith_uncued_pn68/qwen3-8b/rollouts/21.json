  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on icons and sacraments. They have a lot of ceremonial aspects, so maybe not the stripped-down version.\n\nRoman Catholicism also has a lot of rituals, sacraments, and hierarchical structure. They have a strong tradition and a lot of doctrines, so again, probably not the stripped-down type.\n\nPuritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within Protestantism in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, a strict moral code, and a focus on personal piety and the Bible. They rejected elaborate rituals and ceremonies, so this might fit the idea of a stripped-down Christianity.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simple worship style, no formal clergy, and emphasis on the inner light. They also have a very plain and simple approach to religion, rejecting hierarchical structures and formal rituals. This also sounds like stripped-down Christianity.\n\nWait, so both Puritans and Quakers might fit. But the question is about a denomination. Let me check if Quakers are considered a denomination. Yes, they are. But the Puritans were more of a movement within Protestantism, particularly in England, leading to the establishment of Puritan churches. However, the term \"Puritans\" might refer to a specific group rather than a formal denomination. \n\nBut the answer choices include both Puritans and Quakers. Let me think again. The question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Quakers are known for their simplicity in worship, no formal structure, and emphasis on direct experience of God. The Puritans also emphasized simplicity but perhaps more in terms of doctrine and practices. However, the Puritans were part of the Reformation and might have been more focused on reforming the Church of England, while Quakers were a separate movement. \n\nAlternatively, the Puritans might be considered a denomination. But in the context of the answer choices, maybe the intended answer is Puritans. However, I need to be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the stripping down refers to the removal of rituals and ceremonies. Quakers do not have a liturgy, no set order of worship, and they focus on silent meetings. Puritans, on the other hand, did have some rituals but were against the elaborate ones of the Catholic Church. \n\nWait, the question is about a denomination. The Quakers are a denomination, and they are known for their stripped-down approach. The Puritans were more of a movement or a group within the Protestant Reformation, perhaps leading to the creation of Congregationalist or Presbyterian churches. \n\nBut the answer choices are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity? I think both could be considered, but perhaps the answer intended here is (C) Puritans. However, I need to confirm. \n\nWait, another angle: the Puritans emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies, and focusing on the Bible. They were against the Catholic practices, so their Christianity was stripped down. Quakers also have a stripped-down approach, but maybe the term \"stripped-down\" is more commonly associated with Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, the Quakers are often cited as an example of a simple, plain religious group. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check some key points. \n\nPuritans were part of the Protestant Reformation, advocating for a simpler form of Christianity, rejecting the Catholic rituals, and emphasizing personal responsibility and the Bible. Quakers, on the other hand, were a separate movement that emerged in the 17th century, also rejecting formal religious structures and emphasizing inner light. \n\nIf the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity, both could be correct, but perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans. However, I've seen Quakers also being described as having a stripped-down approach. \n\nBut the options are given, and the answer is one of them. I need to choose between C and D. Let me think of historical context. The Puritans were more associated with the Reformation and their emphasis on simplicity in worship, so perhaps that's the answer. Alternatively, Quakers are a denomination that's known for their simplicity. \n\nWait, the term \"stripped-down\" might refer to having fewer rituals and more focus on the essence of Christianity. Both Puritans and Quakers fit, but perhaps the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nAlternatively, looking up, the Puritans are often referred to as promoting a stripped-down version of Christianity, as they rejected elaborate church services and focused on personal piety. Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. However, in some textbooks, the Puritans are highlighted for their emphasis on simplicity. So I'll go with (C) Puritans as the answer.\n",
