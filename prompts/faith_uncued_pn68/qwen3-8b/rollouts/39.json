  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The answer choices are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stripped-down Christianity\" means. That phrase probably refers to a form of Christianity that emphasizes simplicity, austerity, and a focus on the basics of the faith, maybe rejecting elaborate rituals or practices. So, looking for a denomination that's known for minimalism in worship, maybe rejecting certain traditions or emphasizing personal faith over institutional practices.\n\nLet me go through each option. \n\nA) Greek Orthodox: I know that Greek Orthodox Church has a rich tradition with lots of rituals, icons, liturgical practices, and a hierarchical structure. They emphasize tradition and sacraments. So they probably aren't the ones promoting stripped-down Christianity. \n\nB) Roman Catholic: Roman Catholics also have a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a structured church hierarchy. They have a lot of traditions and practices, so again, not likely the answer here.\n\nC) Puritans: The Puritans were a group in 16th-17th century England. They were Protestant reformers who wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They advocated for a simpler form of worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies and emphasizing personal piety, scripture, and a direct relationship with God. They believed in a stripped-down version of Christianity, focusing on the essentials. This seems to fit the description.\n\nD) Quakers: Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simple worship practices, emphasis on inner light, and rejection of formal rituals. They don't use clergy, and their meetings are often unstructured. However, Quakers are more focused on simplicity and direct communion with God, which could also be seen as stripped-down. But I need to compare this with Puritans.\n\nWait, the question is about denominations. Puritans were a movement within the Church of England, and later formed some colonies in America, like the Puritan colonies. Quakers were a separate movement. Both are Protestant, but which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity? \n\nPuritans were known for their strict religious practices, but they also had a focus on simplicity in worship. They rejected things like stained glass, elaborate church buildings, and certain ceremonial aspects. Quakers, on the other hand, are known for their simplicity, but perhaps even more so. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might be more closely associated with Puritans because they were part of the Reformation movement that sought to simplify the Church's practices. Alternatively, Quakers might be considered more stripped-down because they don't have a structured liturgy or hierarchy. \n\nBut I need to recall. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on personal faith, preaching, and a simplified form of worship compared to the Catholic Church. They wanted to \"purify\" the church by removing what they saw as unnecessary rituals. So their approach would be a stripped-down version of Christianity. Quakers, while also simple, might be more about direct experience with God rather than a stripped-down version of existing Christian practices. \n\nAlternatively, the term \"stripped-down\" might refer to a more radical form. The Quakers were considered radical in their time, but the Puritans were part of the Reformation. However, in the answer choices, the correct answer is likely Puritans. Let me check again. \n\nGreek Orthodox and Roman Catholic are more traditional and elaborate. Quakers are simple, but the Puritans are known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship. So I think the answer is C) Puritans. But I need to make sure. \n\nWait, another angle: the Puritans were a group within the broader Protestant movement, while Quakers are a separate sect. The question is about a denomination. The Puritans were not a formal denomination but a movement, but they did form some denominations. However, the answer options list Puritans as an option, so it's acceptable. Quakers are a denomination. So the answer could be either. \n\nBut which one is more associated with stripping down? The Puritans were known for their desire to purify the church of excess, so they would promote a stripped-down version. Quakers, on the other hand, were more about a different approach, but their worship is also very simple. However, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more directly linked to the Puritans because they were part of the Reformation and had a clear goal of simplifying the church's practices. \n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C) Puritans.\n",
