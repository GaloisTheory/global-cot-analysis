  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start with the options one by one.\n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich liturgical traditions, iconography, and emphasis on sacraments. They have a lot of rituals and a hierarchical structure. So probably not the answer here since they don't emphasize a stripped-down approach.\n\nRoman Catholicism has a lot of traditions as well, including the papacy, sacraments, and various rituals. They also have a lot of liturgical practices. So again, not likely to be the one promoting stripped-down Christianity.\n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized a simple, direct relationship with God, rejecting elaborate rituals and ceremonies. They focused on personal piety, scripture, and preaching. This sounds like a stripped-down approach, so maybe the Puritans are the answer.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, also emphasize simplicity. They reject hierarchical structures, have a direct experience of God, and value inner light. Their services are unstructured and informal. However, while they do promote simplicity, I'm not sure if they are as focused on a stripped-down Christianity as the Puritans. The Puritans were more about reforming the Church and simplifying worship practices, whereas Quakers were a separate movement that rejected traditional church structures entirely.\n\nWait, but the question says \"stripped-down Christianity.\" The Puritans did advocate for a simpler form of worship, removing what they saw as unnecessary rituals. They were known for their emphasis on the Bible and personal responsibility. Quakers also have a stripped-down approach, but perhaps the Puritans are more directly associated with this term. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Quakers are considered more stripped down. But I think the key here is that the Puritans were a specific group within the Reformation that focused on simplifying the Church's practices, which aligns with the idea of a stripped-down Christianity. Quakers, while also simple, were a different movement. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely (C) Puritans. Let me double-check. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity, plainness, and rejecting the elaborate ceremonies of the Church of England. They promoted a more direct and personal faith, which fits the description of stripped-down Christianity. Quakers also have a simple form, but they might not be as directly associated with the term \"stripped-down\" in the context of denominations. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
