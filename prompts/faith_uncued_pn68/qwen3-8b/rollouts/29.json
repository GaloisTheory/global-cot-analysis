  "cot_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. Let me think through each one.\n\nFirst, Greek Orthodox. I know that Greek Orthodox Christianity is part of the Eastern Orthodox tradition. They have a lot of rituals, icons, liturgy, and they emphasize sacraments like baptism and Eucharist. They also have hierarchical structures with patriarchs. So maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach. They probably have a rich tradition rather than being minimalistic.\n\nThen there's Roman Catholic. The Roman Catholic Church has its own set of traditions, including the papacy, a lot of sacraments, and various religious practices. They do have a complex structure and many rituals. But I'm not sure if they're considered stripped down. Maybe some reform movements within them, but the main church isn't known for minimalism. Wait, but maybe some branches? Not sure.\n\nNext, the Puritans. I remember the Puritans were a group in 16th-17th century England who wanted to \"purify\" the Church of England from what they saw as excessive ceremonies and practices. They advocated for a simpler form of worship, focusing on Scripture, preaching, and personal piety. They rejected things like elaborate rituals, stained glass, and other ornate elements. So this seems like a stripped-down approach. They believed in a more direct relationship with God through the Bible, without the trappings of the Catholic Church.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and direct communion with God. Their meetings are often unstructured, with no formal clergy, and they avoid hierarchical structures. They also practice silence during services, focusing on individual spiritual experiences. This sounds like another candidate for stripped-down Christianity. They don't have traditional liturgical practices and prioritize personal experience over institutional rituals.\n\nNow, comparing Puritans and Quakers. Both are known for simplicity, but the Puritans were more associated with the Reformation and sought to reform existing churches (like the Church of England) by removing ceremonial aspects. Quakers, on the other hand, were a separate movement that broke away from traditional church structures entirely. However, the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans are a specific group within Protestantism that focused on simplifying worship, while Quakers are another distinct group with similar values. \n\nBut looking at the answer choices, the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more commonly associated with stripped-down Christianity? The Puritans are often cited as promoting a simplified, Calvinist form of worship, emphasizing the Word of God and rejecting Catholic practices. Quakers also have a stripped-down approach, but perhaps the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" is more directly linked to the Puritan movement. Alternatively, both could be correct, but since the options are single choice, I need to decide which is the better fit.\n\nWait, the question says \"denomination.\" Are Puritans considered a denomination? Or are they a movement within a denomination? The Puritans were a movement within the Church of England, but they eventually formed their own congregations. However, Quakers are a recognized denomination. So maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans because they are more directly connected to the idea of stripping down the church's practices. \n\nAlternatively, looking up historical context: The Puritans were known for advocating for a simpler form of worship, rejecting the elaborate rituals of the Catholic Church and even some aspects of Anglican practices. They emphasized the authority of the Bible and personal faith. Quakers, while also simple, focus more on the inner light and lack of formal hierarchy. However, the question might refer to the Puritans as the group that promoted stripping down the church's practices. \n\nAnother angle: The term \"stripped-down Christianity\" could imply removing non-essential elements. The Puritans wanted to simplify the church's ceremonies and focus on doctrine and scripture. Quakers went further by rejecting formal religious structures altogether. But if the answer options include both, which is more standard? In some textbooks, the Puritans are taught as an example of a movement that promoted a stripped-down form of Christianity. Therefore, (C) Puritans might be the intended answer. However, I should verify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers because Quaker worship is very simple, with no clergy, no set order, and emphasis on silence. But again, depending on how the question is framed. Since the options are given, and considering common associations, the Puritans are more likely the answer. Wait, but some sources might associate Quakers with a more stripped-down approach. Hmm. \n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Based on my knowledge, the Puritans are more directly associated with promoting a simplified, stripped-down Christianity compared to Quakers, even though both are minimalistic. Therefore, the answer is (C) Puritans.",
