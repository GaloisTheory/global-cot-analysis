  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox is a branch of Eastern Christianity. They have a lot of traditions, like icons, elaborate liturgy, and specific rituals. They probably don't emphasize a stripped-down approach. So maybe not A.\n\nRoman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination. They have a lot of sacraments, a hierarchical structure, and a lot of traditions. They also have a rich liturgical life. So B might not be the answer either, since they aren't known for being stripped down.\n\nNow, Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Church of England in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church of what they saw as corrupt practices, like elaborate rituals and hierarchical structures. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, focusing on the Bible and personal faith. So maybe C is a candidate here. They did promote a more stripped-down version of Christianity, removing what they considered unnecessary elements.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They are known for their simplicity, direct experience of God, and rejection of formal rituals. They emphasize inner light and community. So D could also be a possibility. \n\nWait, but the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. Both Puritans and Quakers are known for simplicity. But which one is more associated with that? The Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation and focused on simplifying worship, preaching, and church practices. Quakers are a different group, more radical in some ways, and they rejected traditional church structures entirely. \n\nHowever, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer more to the Puritans' approach. The Quakers also had a stripped-down approach, but maybe the answer is C? Or perhaps D? \n\nWait, I need to check if the Puritans are considered a denomination. The Puritans were a movement within the Church of England, but they didn't form their own denomination. However, some groups like the Congregationalists were influenced by Puritan ideas. Alternatively, the Quakers are a distinct denomination. \n\nBut the answer choices include Puritans as an option. So maybe the answer is C. Alternatively, the Quakers are more known for their simplicity. But I think the Puritans are more associated with stripping down the church's practices. \n\nAnother angle: stripped-down Christianity often refers to simplicity in worship, rejecting rituals, focusing on the Bible, and personal faith. The Puritans did that. Quakers also do that, but perhaps the question is looking for the Puritans. \n\nWait, but the answer might be the Quakers. Because the Quakers are known for their simple worship, no formal clergy, and direct communion with God. However, the Puritans were more about reforming the Church of England to be simpler. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is C, Puritans. But I'm a bit confused because Quakers also fit. Let me check my notes. \n\nWait, the Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation and were known for their emphasis on a simplified form of worship, rejecting Catholic traditions. They wanted to \"purify\" the church. Quakers, on the other hand, were more radical and separated from the church entirely, rejecting formal structures. \n\nSo if the question is about promoting a stripped-down Christianity, both could be considered. But which one is more commonly associated with that term? Maybe the Puritans. Alternatively, the Quakers might be seen as more stripped down. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is D, Quakers, because they are known for their simplicity and minimalism. But I need to confirm. \n\nAnother thought: The term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to the Puritans' focus on the essentials of the faith, like the Bible and personal salvation, without the elaborate rituals and hierarchy. Quakers also have this, but perhaps the answer is C. \n\nWait, looking up some quick facts: The Puritans were known for their strict adherence to the Bible and their rejection of ceremonial practices. Quakers emphasized simplicity in worship, no clergy, and inner light. \n\nBut the question is about a denomination. The Puritans weren't a denomination but a movement. However, the answer choices include (C) Puritans. So maybe the intended answer is C. Alternatively, if the Quakers are considered a denomination, then D. \n\nIn the options given, the answer is likely C, Puritans. But I'm not 100% sure. However, I think the correct answer is C. Let me go with that.\n",
