  "cot_content": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. Let's start by understanding what \"stripped-down Christianity\" means. That probably refers to a simpler, more direct form of the religion, maybe with fewer rituals or ceremonies, focusing more on the basics of faith.\n\nLooking at the answer choices: Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, Quakers. Let me think about each one.\n\nGreek Orthodox Church is part of the Eastern Orthodox tradition. They have a lot of rituals, icons, liturgy, and a complex structure. They probably aren't the ones promoting a stripped-down version. So maybe not (A).\n\nRoman Catholic Church is a major denomination with a lot of sacraments, rituals, and a hierarchical structure. They have a lot of traditions and ceremonies, so again, not likely to be stripped-down. So (B) might not be the answer.\n\nPuritans were a group in 16th-17th century England. They were Protestant reformers who wanted to simplify worship and remove what they saw as unnecessary rituals. They believed in a more direct relationship with God, emphasizing personal faith and scripture. So maybe (C) is the answer.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simple worship practices, lack of formal clergy, and emphasis on spiritual equality. They don't use formal prayers or sermons, and their meetings are very quiet. This also sounds like stripped-down Christianity. So (D) could be a contender.\n\nWait, but the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. Puritans were a specific group within Protestantism, and Quakers are another distinct group. Which one is more associated with simplicity?\n\nPuritans focused on simplifying the Church of England's practices, removing things like elaborate ceremonies and hierarchical structures. They emphasized the Bible and personal piety. Quakers, on the other hand, rejected formal liturgy altogether, had no set order of service, and focused on inner light. Both seem to have stripped-down aspects, but perhaps the Puritans are more known for that. However, Quakers are also known for their simplicity. \n\nBut let me think again. The term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to a more austere form. The Puritans were part of the Reformation, seeking to purify the church, which could mean simplifying. Quakers were even more radical, rejecting traditional church structures. However, in the context of the answer choices, which one is more commonly associated with a stripped-down approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Because they were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship and doctrine, and they were part of the Protestant movement that sought to strip away Catholic practices. Quakers are more of a separate movement, but maybe the answer is (D). Wait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. \n\nI need to recall historical context. The Puritans were a group within the Anglican Church, but they wanted to purify it, remove elaborate rituals, and focus on scripture. Quakers were a different group that didn't even have a set form of worship, which might make them more stripped down. However, the question is about a denomination. The Puritans were a movement, not a denomination, but in the answer choices, (C) is listed as an option. Wait, the answer choices are (A) Greek Orthodox, (B) Roman Catholic, (C) Puritans, (D) Quakers. So the Puritans are considered here as a denomination? Maybe in the context of the question, they are. \n\nAlternatively, the Quakers are a denomination. So which one is more known for stripped-down? I think the Puritans are more associated with simplifying the church's practices, so maybe (C). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, some sources might say Quakers. \n\nWait, another angle: stripped-down Christianity could refer to a more minimalist approach, like rejecting formal structures. The Quakers don't have a clergy, and their services are very simple. The Puritans did have some structure but simplified the Church of England's practices. Maybe the answer is (C) or (D). \n\nI think the key here is that the Puritans are more known for their emphasis on simplicity and stripping away unnecessary elements, while Quakers are more known for their lack of formal rituals. However, the answer might be (C) Puritans. Alternatively, maybe (D) Quakers. \n\nBut I need to check. For example, the Quakers are often described as having a very simple form of worship, no set order, and no clergy. They emphasize the inner light and direct communion with God. This could be seen as stripped-down. The Puritans also rejected elaborate ceremonies, but they were part of the Anglican Church and had some structure. \n\nIn that case, both could be candidates, but since the question is about denominations, and Quakers are a denomination, while Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans, as they were a specific denomination. Wait, but Puritans weren't a separate denomination. They were part of the Church of England, but some formed separate congregations. However, in the answer choices, (C) is listed as an option. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be (D) Quakers. I think I've seen sources that mention Quakers as promoting a stripped-down form of Christianity. But I need to be careful. \n\nAnother thought: the Puritans were known for their emphasis on personal faith and the Bible, which could be seen as stripping down to the essentials. Quakers also emphasized simplicity, but perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans. \n\nWait, the answer might be (C) Puritans. Let me check. The Puritans were a group that wanted to purify the church, remove Catholic elements, and simplify worship. They promoted a more direct, personal faith without the elaborate rituals. So that's a stripped-down version. Quakers, on the other hand, were even more radical, but they are a different movement. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
