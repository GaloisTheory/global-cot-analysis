  "cot_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, icons, and the use of elaborate rituals. They have a strong emphasis on tradition and sacraments, so maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nRoman Catholicism also has a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure. They have many rituals and ceremonies. So probably not them either. \n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Protestant Reformation who wanted to simplify church practices. They rejected what they saw as excessive rituals and focused on personal piety, scripture study, and a more direct relationship with God. They believed in a simpler form of worship, so this might align with \"stripped-down\" Christianity.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, also emphasize simplicity. They don't have formal clergy, and their meetings are often unstructured. They focus on inner light and direct communion with God. However, I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination that specifically promotes a stripped-down version of Christianity. They do have a very simple form of worship, but I need to compare them with the Puritans.\n\nWait, the term \"stripped-down\" might refer to removing unnecessary elements. The Puritans were known for their Calvinist beliefs and their desire to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They advocated for a more simplified worship, plain clothing, and a focus on the Bible. Quakers also have a similar simplicity, but perhaps the Puritans are more directly associated with promoting a stripped-down form of Christianity, especially in the context of the Reformation era.\n\nSo between the Puritans and Quakers. But I think the Puritans are more accurately described as promoting a stripped-down Christianity compared to Quakers. Quakers are another branch with their own distinct practices, but the Puritans are more commonly associated with simplifying religious practices. Therefore, the answer is likely (C) Puritans.",
