  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on mysticism and sacraments. They have a lot of rituals and a complex structure, so I don't think they fit the \"stripped-down\" description.\n\nRoman Catholicism is another major denomination. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a hierarchical structure with the Pope. While there are some reform movements within Catholicism, the mainstream Catholic Church isn't typically described as stripped-down. They have a lot of rituals and doctrines, so maybe not the answer.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the 16th and 17th century Protestant movement. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corrupt practices. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing on personal faith and scripture. They advocated for a more direct and stripped-down version of Christianity, focusing on the Bible and personal piety. This seems to align with the question's description.\n\nQuakers, on the other hand, are another Protestant group. They emphasize direct communication with God, inner light, and simplicity. Quakers are known for their plain dress, unprogrammed worship services, and rejection of formal rituals. They also promote a simple, inward spirituality. So Quakers might also be considered as promoting a stripped-down Christianity. Wait, but which one is more accurate here?\n\nThe question is about promoting a stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were specifically known for their emphasis on simplicity, rejecting Catholic practices, and promoting a more direct relationship with God through scripture. Quakers also have a similar approach, but maybe the Puritans are more associated with the idea of stripping away ceremonial aspects. However, I need to check if Quakers are considered as promoting a stripped-down Christianity. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Puritans. Because the term \"stripped-down\" might refer to the Puritans' rejection of elaborate church ceremonies and their focus on personal faith. Quakers are also known for simplicity, but perhaps the Puritans are more directly associated with this concept. \n\nWait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. The question is which one is correct. Let me think again. The Puritans were part of the Reformation, seeking to purify the church by removing non-essential practices. They believed in a simple form of worship, emphasizing the Bible, predestination, and personal responsibility. Quakers, while also simple in their practices, were a separate movement that emerged later, focusing on the inner light and direct communion with God. \n\nBut the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more commonly associated with the Puritans. However, I should verify. For example, Quakers are known for their simplicity in worship, not having a formal clergy, and their plain dress. But the Puritans were more focused on removing the \"papal\" influence and simplifying the church's practices. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers. But I'm not sure. Let me think of other factors. The Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation, and their movement led to the establishment of Puritan communities in America. They emphasized a plain, simple form of worship. Quakers, on the other hand, are a distinct group. \n\nAnother angle: the term \"stripped-down\" might refer to the rejection of elaborate rituals. Both Puritans and Quakers would fit, but perhaps the answer is Quakers. Wait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. \n\nIn some sources, the Puritans are often described as promoting a stripped-down version of Christianity, focusing on simplicity and the Bible. Quakers are also known for simplicity, but perhaps the answer here is (C) Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. I need to be careful. Let me check some key points. \n\nThe Puritans were known for their emphasis on a plain, simple, and unadorned form of worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies and rituals. They wanted to purify the Church of England by removing what they saw as unnecessary practices. This aligns with the idea of a stripped-down Christianity. \n\nQuakers, on the other hand, emphasize the \"inner light\" and have a simple form of worship without a structured liturgy. They also have a more egalitarian structure. So both could be considered, but the question is which one is the correct answer here. \n\nLooking back, the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. In some contexts, the Puritans are more associated with stripping down the Church's practices, but Quakers are also known for simplicity. However, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more commonly linked to the Puritans. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the Puritans were part of the Reformation movement that sought to simplify the Church and remove what they considered unnecessary elements, leading to a more direct and stripped-down form of Christianity. Quakers, while also simple, might not be as directly associated with this term. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is likely (C) Puritans.\n",
