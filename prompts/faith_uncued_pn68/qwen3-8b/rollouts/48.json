  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Stripped-down Christianity might refer to a simpler form of worship, less emphasis on rituals, or a focus on core beliefs. \n\nGreek Orthodox is known for its rich traditions, icons, and elaborate rituals. They have a lot of liturgical practices, so maybe not the stripped-down version. Roman Catholicism also has a lot of rituals, sacraments, and traditions, so probably not that either.\n\nPuritans were a group in 16th-17th century England. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary ceremonies and rituals. They emphasized simplicity in worship, a focus on the Bible, and personal piety. So they might be the ones promoting stripped-down Christianity. \n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, also emphasize simplicity, but I think they are more about inner light and direct communion with God, rather than necessarily stripping down the church. They were also known for their pacifism and simplicity in lifestyle. But I'm not as sure about their emphasis on stripping down the Christian practices compared to Puritans.\n\nWait, the Puritans were specifically focused on reforming the Church of England by removing what they considered to be Catholic practices. They wanted a more simplified form of worship, so that aligns with stripped-down Christianity. Quakers, while also emphasizing simplicity, might have a different focus. So between Puritans and Quakers. But the question is about denominations. Quakers are a denomination, but Puritans were a movement within the Church of England. However, the answer choices include Puritans as an option. \n\nLooking up, the Puritans are often associated with the Protestant Reformation and their emphasis on simplicity, so I think the answer is C. Puritans.\n",
