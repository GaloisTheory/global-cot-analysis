  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, including elaborate liturgies, icons, and a strong emphasis on mysticism and sacraments. They have a hierarchical structure with the Patriarch as the leader. So I don't think they're known for being stripped down. They probably have a lot of rituals and traditions.\n\nRoman Catholicism is another big one. They have a lot of sacraments, a hierarchical structure with the Pope, and a lot of traditions. They also have a complex set of doctrines and rituals. So again, not really stripped down. They might have some variations, but generally, they're not considered minimalistic.\n\nNow, Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within Protestantism in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as corruption and unnecessary practices. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, rejecting things like elaborate ceremonies, stained glass, and other adornments. They focused more on the Bible, personal piety, and a direct relationship with God. So this sounds like a stripped-down version of Christianity, removing the excesses they thought were present in the Church of England and even in Catholicism.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They are known for their simplicity, pacifism, and direct experience of God. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their meetings are often unstructured. They also emphasize inner light and personal revelation. Quakers are definitely known for simplicity in their worship practices, but I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity. They might be part of the broader Puritan movement or a separate group. \n\nWait, but the question is about which denomination. Puritans are a movement within Protestantism, but they didn't form a single denomination. However, some groups like the Congregationalists or Presbyterians were influenced by Puritan ideas. But the term \"Puritans\" itself refers to a movement rather than a single denomination. However, in the answer choices, (C) is Puritans, so maybe that's the intended answer. \n\nAlternatively, Quakers are a distinct denomination that emphasizes simplicity. But I think the Puritans are more associated with stripping away the elaborate practices of the Church of England. They wanted a more austere form of worship. So perhaps the answer is (C) Puritans. \n\nLet me double-check. The Quakers do have a stripped-down approach, but the Puritans are also known for that. However, the question is about a denomination. The Puritans were a movement, not a denomination, but maybe in the context of the options, they are considered as such. Alternatively, maybe Quakers are the answer. \n\nWait, the options are (A) Greek Orthodox, (B) Roman Catholic, (C) Puritans, (D) Quakers. \n\nI think the key here is that Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity, rejecting the ceremonial aspects of the Church. They advocated for a more direct, Bible-based worship. So even though they weren't a single denomination, they are listed as an option. Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but perhaps the Puritans are more associated with stripping down the church. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The Quakers were founded in the 17th century, and they rejected formal religious structures, including clergy, and emphasized inner light. They are often seen as a simple, stripped-down form of Christianity. \n\nBut the Puritans were also known for stripping down the church's practices. So which one is more accurate? The question says \"denomination,\" so Puritans might not be a denomination but a movement. However, in the answer choices, (C) is listed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) because the Puritans were a group that promoted simplicity. \n\nI think the correct answer is (C) Puritans. But I need to be careful. Alternatively, Quakers are also known for simplicity. \n\nWait, the options are given, and the answer choices are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more correct? \n\nI think the Puritans are more associated with stripping down the church's practices, such as removing elaborate rituals and focusing on the Bible. Quakers, while simple, have different origins. But given the options, the answer is likely (C) Puritans. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (C).\n",
