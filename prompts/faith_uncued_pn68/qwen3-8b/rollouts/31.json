  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The answer choices are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on icons, sacraments, and the veneration of saints. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so maybe they aren't the ones with a stripped-down approach.\n\nRoman Catholicism is another major denomination. They have a lot of traditions as well, like the papacy, sacraments, and various liturgical practices. But I think they also have a lot of structure and rituals, so maybe not the stripped-down version.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Anglican Church in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church of what they saw as unnecessary practices, like elaborate rituals, ornate church decorations, and maybe even some Catholic influences. They emphasized simplicity in worship, a focus on the Bible, and personal piety. So their approach was more about stripping away the excesses and focusing on the basics of Christianity. That makes them a candidate for \"stripped-down\" Christianity.\n\nQuakers, on the other hand, are another denomination. They emphasize direct communication with God, inner light, and simplicity. They don't have a formal clergy, and their services are usually very informal. Quakers also value simplicity in their lifestyle and worship. So maybe they also fit the description. \n\nWait, but the question is about which denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. Both Puritans and Quakers might be considered. But I need to think which one is more known for that. \n\nThe Puritans were specifically focused on purifying the church from what they considered corruptions, which included things like elaborate ceremonies, which they saw as unnecessary. Their version of Christianity was more about simplicity, personal faith, and a direct relationship with God, without the excesses of the established church. Quakers also emphasize simplicity, but they are a different group. \n\nI think the Puritans are more associated with the idea of stripping down the church's practices. Quakers, while also simple, might be more about their unique practices like silent meetings. But the question is about a denomination. The Puritans are a specific group, though they were part of the broader Protestant movement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers. Wait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more accurate? \n\nI need to check. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate rituals and focusing on the Word of God. They were also strict about moral conduct. Quakers, on the other hand, are a more distinct group that didn't have the same liturgical structure, but their emphasis on simplicity and direct experience of God might also fit. However, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more directly associated with the Puritans, as they were part of the Reformation movement that sought to simplify church practices. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers because they are known for their plain dress and simple worship. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The Puritans were a movement within the Anglican Church that wanted to remove what they saw as Catholic practices, so their version was more stripped down. Quakers, while also simple, might have different origins. \n\nI think the answer is (C) Puritans. But I'm not 100% sure. Wait, the question says \"denomination,\" and Puritans were a group, not a denomination. Wait, but the options are given as (C) Puritans. Maybe in the context of the question, they are considered as a denomination. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. Because Quakers are known for their simplicity, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check some key points. \n\nPuritanism was a movement within Protestantism that sought to \"purify\" the church by removing superstitious practices and emphasizing a personal relationship with God. They rejected the elaborate rituals of the Church of England and wanted a more direct, stripped-down form of worship. \n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, emphasize simplicity, humility, and the inner light. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their meetings are silent except for those who feel led to speak. They also advocate for social justice and pacifism. \n\nSo both Puritans and Quakers have elements of simplicity. However, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more aligned with the Puritans, as they were part of the Reformation and focused on simplifying religious practices. Quakers, while also simple, are a different tradition. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers because they are more known for their plain lifestyle and simple worship. But I'm not certain. \n\nWait, the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were a movement, but if the options include them as an answer, then (C) would be the correct choice. However, the Quakers are also known for simplicity. \n\nI think the answer is (C) Puritans. Because the Puritans were specifically known for stripping down the Church's practices. So the answer would be (C).\n",
