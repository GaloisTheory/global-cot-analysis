  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on icons and sacraments. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies. So maybe not the stripped-down version.\n\nRoman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a structured hierarchy. They also have a lot of religious practices and rituals. So again, not the stripped-down version. \n\nThen there's the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in the 16th and 17th centuries who wanted to \"purify\" the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary rituals and practices. They believed in a simpler form of worship, focusing on the Bible and personal faith. They rejected elaborate ceremonies and emphasized preaching and personal Bible study. So this sounds like a stripped-down Christianity.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simple worship practices. They don't have a structured hierarchy, and their meetings are often silent, with members sharing their insights. They also emphasize inner light and simplicity. So Quakers might also be considered as promoting a stripped-down approach. \n\nWait, but the question is asking which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. The Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, while Quakers are a separate denomination. I need to check which one is more known for simplicity. \n\nThe Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, rejecting the \"popery\" of the Catholic Church, which they saw as too elaborate. They wanted a more direct and personal relationship with God without the ornate rituals. Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but they are a different group. \n\nBut the answer options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity? \n\nI think the Puritans are more commonly associated with the idea of a stripped-down Christianity, especially in the context of the 16th and 17th centuries. Quakers also have simplicity, but maybe the Puritans are more directly linked to the idea of stripping away rituals. \n\nSo the answer might be (C) Puritans. Alternatively, maybe (D) Quakers? Wait, the question is about denominations. Are the Puritans considered a denomination? Well, the Puritans were a movement within the Church of England that eventually led to the formation of some denominations like the Congregationalists. But in the context of the options given, (C) Puritans is listed as an option. \n\nAlternatively, the Quakers are a denomination that emphasizes simplicity. So which is more correct? \n\nI think the Puritans are more known for their stripped-down approach. However, Quakers are also known for simplicity. But maybe the answer is (C) Puritans. Let me check some key points. \n\nThe Puritans were known for their strict moral code, their emphasis on personal Bible reading, and simplicity in worship. They rejected the elaborate rituals of the Church of England. Quakers, on the other hand, are known for their silent meetings and lack of formal hierarchy. Both have elements of simplicity, but the Puritans might be more directly associated with the idea of stripping down the Church's practices. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
