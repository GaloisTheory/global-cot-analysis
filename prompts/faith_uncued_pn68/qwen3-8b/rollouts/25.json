  "cot_content": "\nOkay, so the question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers. Let me think through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stripped-down Christianity\" means. That term might refer to a simpler, more minimalist form of Christianity, perhaps focusing on the essentials of the faith and rejecting certain traditions, rituals, or hierarchical structures. It could also relate to a more personal or direct relationship with God, without complex theological systems.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA) Greek Orthodox: I know that the Greek Orthodox Church has a rich tradition, with a lot of rituals, icons, and liturgical practices. They have a strong emphasis on tradition, the seven sacraments, and a hierarchical structure with the Patriarch. They're not known for being stripped down; rather, they're quite elaborate in their worship and practices. So maybe not this one.\n\nB) Roman Catholic: The Roman Catholic Church also has a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a structured hierarchy. They have a lot of rituals and sacraments, so again, not the stripped-down version. They emphasize the Church's authority and tradition, so probably not the answer.\n\nC) Puritans: The Puritans were a group within the 16th and 17th century Protestant movement. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary practices and rituals. They believed in a simpler form of worship, focusing on the Bible and personal faith. They rejected things like elaborate ceremonies, musical instruments in worship, and the episcopal structure. So this seems like a candidate for stripped-down Christianity. They emphasized simplicity, directness, and the authority of Scripture.\n\nD) Quakers: Quakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are known for their simple worship practices. They don't have a formal clergy, and their meetings are often silent, with members sharing insights. They emphasize inner light and personal experience of God. Their practices are indeed minimalistic, with no set liturgy, and they reject hierarchical structures. So Quakers also fit the idea of stripped-down Christianity.\n\nNow, the question is between Puritans and Quakers. Let me think more. The term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might be more associated with Puritans, who were part of the Protestant Reformation and focused on simplifying worship and removing Catholic influences. Quakers, on the other hand, were a separate movement that emerged later, in the 17th century, with even more minimal practices. However, the question is about which denomination promotes it. The Puritans were a specific group within Protestantism, while Quakers are a distinct denomination. \n\nBut the answer choices include both. Let me check if the term \"stripped-down\" is more commonly associated with either. The Puritans are often described as advocating for a \"pure\" or \"stripped-down\" form of Christianity, emphasizing the Bible and rejecting rituals. Quakers also have a stripped-down approach, but maybe the term is more directly linked to the Puritans. However, some sources might consider Quakers as well. Wait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the Puritans were more focused on reforming the Church of England, while Quakers formed their own separate congregation. The Puritans were more about simplifying worship, whereas Quakers went further in their simplicity. But the question is about which denomination promotes stripped-down Christianity. The answer might be both, but since only one option is correct, I need to determine which is more accurate.\n\nAnother angle: the Puritans are a Protestant group that rejected the ceremonial aspects of the Anglican Church, leading to the creation of Congregationalist and Presbyterian churches. They emphasized simplicity in worship, but they still had some structure. Quakers, on the other hand, have even less structure, no formal clergy, and their worship is very simple. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might be more commonly associated with Puritans in historical contexts. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers because they are known for their simple, unstructured worship. However, some sources might say Puritans. Wait, the original question is about denominations. The Puritans weren't a denomination but a movement within Protestantism. However, the answer options list them as (C) Puritans, so perhaps they are considered as a denomination here. Similarly, Quakers are a denomination. \n\nIn that case, both are denominations. But which one is known for stripped-down Christianity? Let me check. The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity and the rejection of Catholic practices, while Quakers are known for their simplicity in worship, no formal hierarchy, and direct communion with God. \n\nBut the question is about which denomination. The answer could be both, but since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is (C) Puritans. However, I'm a bit confused because Quakers are also known for simplicity. Wait, maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, let me think again. The term \"stripped-down\" might refer to more minimalism. Quakers have no clergy, no set rituals, and their meetings are silent. That seems more stripped down. However, the Puritans were also known for stripping away Catholic practices. But perhaps the answer is (C). \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be (C) and (D), but the options are single choice. Maybe the intended answer is (C) Puritans. But I'm not entirely certain. \n\nWait, another approach: the Puritans were a group that wanted to purify the Church of England, so they were called Puritans because they wanted to purify it, removing the \"popish\" elements. Their approach was to strip down the Church of England's practices, leading to a simpler form of worship. So this aligns with the idea of stripped-down Christianity. Quakers, while also simple, were a different movement. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Puritans.\n",
