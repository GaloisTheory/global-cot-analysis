  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start with the Greek Orthodox Church. They have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgies. They believe in the use of icons, elaborate ceremonies, and have a complex structure with the Patriarch and various hierarchies. So I don't think they're known for being stripped down. They probably have a rich tradition rather than a minimalist approach.\n\nNext, the Roman Catholic Church. They also have a lot of rituals, sacraments, and traditions. They have a centralized authority in the Pope, and their practices are quite formal. While there are some conservative groups within Catholicism, the mainstream Catholic Church isn't typically described as stripped down. So maybe not B either.\n\nThen there are the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the 16th and 17th century Protestant movement. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary practices, like Catholic rituals. They emphasized a simpler form of worship, rejecting things like elaborate ceremonies, music, and even certain types of church architecture. They focused more on the Bible, personal piety, and a direct relationship with God. This sounds like a stripped-down approach, so maybe C is the answer.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another option. They are known for their simplicity in worship, not using formal liturgy, and emphasizing inner light and direct communion with God. They also don't have a hierarchical structure, and their meetings are often quite informal. However, I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity in the same way as the Puritans. The Puritans were specifically focused on simplifying the Church of England's practices, whereas Quakers started as a separate movement with their own distinct beliefs. \n\nWait, but the question is about a denomination. The Puritans were a movement within the Church of England, but they weren't a separate denomination. However, some Puritan groups did form their own congregations. The Quakers, on the other hand, are a distinct denomination. So maybe both C and D are possible. But which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity?\n\nThe Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate ceremonies and focusing on the Bible. They also had a strong emphasis on personal responsibility and moral purity. Quakers also emphasize simplicity, but their approach is more about quietness and inner light. However, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" might more directly refer to the Puritans' rejection of Catholic and Anglican traditions, leading to a more austere form of worship. \n\nAlternatively, Quakers might be considered even more stripped down because they don't have a formal liturgy, and their meetings are very simple. But I think the answer is more likely to be the Puritans. Let me check again. The Puritans were definitely associated with a stripped-down version of Christianity, focusing on the essentials of the faith, rejecting what they saw as unnecessary rituals, and emphasizing personal faith and scripture. Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but maybe the term \"stripped-down\" is more commonly linked to the Puritans. \n\nSo, the answer is probably (C) Puritans.\n",
