  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start by breaking down each option.\n\nGreek Orthodox: They are known for their rich traditions, liturgical practices, icons, and the veneration of saints. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so they might not be the ones promoting a stripped-down version.\n\nRoman Catholic: This is a major denomination with a lot of sacraments, hierarchical structure, and papal authority. They also have various traditions and rituals, so again, not exactly stripped down. But wait, maybe there are some groups within Catholicism that are more minimalist? Not sure, but the main branch isn't known for being stripped down.\n\nPuritans: I remember that the Puritans were a group within Protestantism in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as unnecessary rituals and ceremonies. They emphasized simplicity in worship, a focus on the Bible, and personal piety. So this seems like they would promote a stripped-down Christianity, removing elaborate practices.\n\nQuakers: Also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They emphasize direct communication with God, simplicity, and pacifism. Their services are often very informal, without formal clergy or set rituals. They value inner light and personal experience of the divine. This also sounds like a stripped-down approach to Christianity, focusing on simplicity and direct spiritual experience.\n\nNow, I need to compare Puritans and Quakers. Both seem to fit the description. But the question is about a denomination. The Puritans were a movement within Protestantism, possibly leading to the formation of Congregationalist and Presbyterian churches. Quakers are a distinct denomination. \n\nThe term \"stripped-down\" might refer more to removing external rituals and focusing on the essentials. Puritans definitely had that goal, aiming to simplify worship and remove what they considered superstitious practices. Quakers also emphasize simplicity, but perhaps even more so in their practices. However, historically, the Puritans are often associated with the idea of stripping away excess in church practices. \n\nWait, but the answer choices include both Puritans and Quakers. Which one is more accurately described as promoting stripped-down Christianity? The Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, the Word of God, and rejecting elaborate rituals. Quakers also practice simplicity but are part of a different tradition. \n\nLooking up some key points: The Puritans were a group that sought to purify the Church of England by removing ceremonial elements. Quakers, on the other hand, were more radical in their rejection of traditional church structures and rituals. However, the question is asking for the denomination, not the movement. The Puritans themselves formed denominations, while Quakers are a separate denomination. \n\nBut the answer choices list \"Puritans\" as an option, which is a denomination. Wait, technically, the Puritans weren't a single denomination but a movement. However, in the context of the question, it might be acceptable. Alternatively, Quakers are a denomination that does emphasize simplicity. \n\nAnother angle: \"Stripped-down Christianity\" might refer to a more personal and less institutionalized form of faith. The Puritans focused on individual piety and the Bible, while Quakers emphasize direct communion with God. Both could fit, but which is more commonly associated with stripping down? Historically, the Puritans are often cited as advocating for simpler worship practices. \n\nI think the answer is either C or D. To decide, maybe consider that Quakers are more known for their radical simplicity and rejection of formal religious structures. However, the Puritans are more directly associated with the idea of stripping away excess in the Church of England. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"stripped-down\" refers to minimalism in doctrine and practice. The Puritans were more focused on reformed theology and simplifying worship, whereas Quakers are more about experiential spirituality. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is (C) Puritans. Because the question is about a denomination, and the Puritans are a specific group that promoted stripping down of the Church's practices. Quakers are also a denomination but might be seen as more radical in their approach. However, since the options are given, and considering common knowledge, the Puritans are often linked with simplicity in worship.",
