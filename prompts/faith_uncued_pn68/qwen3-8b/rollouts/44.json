  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations emphasizes. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on icons, sacraments, and the veneration of saints. They have a lot of rituals and ceremonies, so they probably aren't the ones promoting a stripped-down version. So maybe not option A.\n\nRoman Catholicism also has a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a structured hierarchy. They have the papacy, various rituals, and a comprehensive set of doctrines. While there might be some reform movements within Catholicism, the mainstream is pretty traditional. So B might not be the answer either.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group in 16th-17th century England who wanted to purify the Church of England from its Catholic practices. They believed in a simpler form of worship, rejecting things like elaborate ceremonies, music, and images. They emphasized personal faith, scripture, and a more direct relationship with God. This sounds like a stripped-down approach compared to the more complex traditions of other denominations. So C could be a strong candidate.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They are known for their simple worship style, which doesn't involve formal rituals or clergy. They emphasize inner light and direct communion with God. Their meetings are often unstructured, and they avoid hierarchical structures. This seems like another group that might fit the \"stripped-down\" description. So D is also possible.\n\nWait, but the question is about a denomination. Are both Puritans and Quakers considered denominations? The Puritans were part of the broader Protestant movement, but they weren't a single denomination. They were a movement within the Church of England and later formed groups like the Congregationalists or Presbyterians. However, in the answer choices, \"Puritans\" is listed as an option. Similarly, Quakers are a distinct denomination. \n\nSo which one is more associated with stripping down Christianity? The Puritans focused on simplifying worship and removing Catholic influences, while Quakers took it even further by eliminating formal rituals, clergy, and even the concept of a central authority. But does the question refer to a specific denomination?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is the Quakers because they are known for a very minimalistic approach. However, the Puritans are also known for their simplicity. Wait, the term \"stripped-down\" in the context of Christianity could mean different things. For example, the Puritans rejected ceremonial aspects, while the Quakers went beyond that by not having any formal structure. \n\nBut perhaps the key here is that the Puritans were advocating for a return to simpler forms of worship, focusing on the Bible and personal piety, whereas Quakers developed their own unique practices. Which one is more commonly associated with being described as a \"stripped-down\" Christianity? Maybe the answer is the Puritans because they were specifically known for their reform efforts to simplify the church. However, I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, looking up some quick facts: The Puritans were part of the Reformed tradition, emphasizing Calvinist theology and a simplified liturgy. Quakers, on the other hand, are considered a radical branch of Protestantism, known for their lack of formal structure. Both have elements of simplicity, but perhaps the Puritans are more directly associated with stripping down the practices of the Church of England. However, the Quakers are also a denomination that promotes simplicity. \n\nHmm, the answer might depend on how strictly we define \"denomination.\" If the Puritans are considered a denomination (though they were more of a movement), then C. But if the answer expects a specific denomination, then Quakers (D) might be the correct choice. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers because they are known for their minimalistic approach. \n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"promotes a stripped-down Christianity.\" The Quakers are known for their unprogrammed meetings, no formal sermons, and no hierarchical structure. They don't use creeds or sacraments in the traditional sense. That sounds like a stripped-down form. The Puritans did have some structure, like congregational governance, but they did reject many Catholic practices. \n\nI think the answer might be Quakers. But I'm a bit torn. Let me check again. The Puritans were part of the Reformation, aiming to purify the Church of England from Catholic practices. They did advocate for simpler worship, but they still had some structure. Quakers, on the other hand, are more extreme in their simplicity. However, the answer options include both C and D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is the Puritans because they were explicitly known for their \"puritan\" movement of simplifying religion. But I'm not 100% certain. Another angle: which of these denominations is more commonly associated with being \"stripped down\"? In some contexts, the term \"stripped down\" might refer to the Puritans' rejection of elaborate rituals. But I'm still not sure. \n\nWait, looking at historical context, the Quakers were founded in the 17th century by George Fox, and they rejected all formal religious structures, including clergy and sacraments, which makes them extremely stripped down. The Puritans, while simplifying, still maintained some structures. Therefore, the Quakers might be the better answer. However, some sources might consider the Puritans as promoting stripped-down Christianity. \n\nBut given the options, I think the answer is (C) Puritans. Wait, no. Wait, the Quakers are known for their simplicity. Maybe I confused something. Let me try to recall: the Quakers are sometimes called the Society of Friends, and their worship is silent, with members speaking when moved by the Spirit. They don't have ministers, so that's a stripped-down approach. The Puritans did have ministers but rejected the Catholic mass and other ceremonies. \n\nIn terms of which is more accurately described as promoting a stripped-down Christianity, I think the answer is Quakers. However, I need to verify. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the Puritans. \n\nLooking up, for example, the Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, so they would be seen as promoting a stripped-down version. Quakers take that even further. But since the options include both, maybe the intended answer is (C) Puritans. Or perhaps (D) Quakers. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the question refers to a denomination, the Quakers are a recognized denomination, while the Puritans were more of a movement. But the answer options list \"Puritans\" as an option. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, based on common knowledge, the Puritans are often associated with stripping down the practices of the Church of England, so they might be the intended answer. Alternatively, Quakers are more extreme. \n\nBut wait, the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" could also refer to a more minimalist approach. If the answer is (C) Puritans, then that's the best choice. Alternatively, (D) Quakers. \n\nAfter re-evaluating, I think the correct answer is (C) Puritans. Because the term \"Puritan\" itself implies a desire to purify and simplify, whereas Quakers are a different movement. However, I'm still uncertain. Maybe the answer is (D) Quakers. \n\nWait, another thought: the Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation, and their goal was to simplify the church's practices, focusing on the Word of God. Quakers, on the other hand, are more radical and have a distinct theology. Given that the question asks for a denomination, and Quakers are a denomination, perhaps (D) is the answer. \n\nBut I need to make a decision here. Based on what I know, the Puritans are often cited as promoting a stripped-down version of Christianity, so I'll go with (C). However, I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, Quakers might be correct. \n\nWait, checking online quickly (hypothetically), the Puritans are known for their emphasis on simplicity and personal devotion, and they are considered to have promoted a stripped-down form of Christianity. Quakers also do, but maybe the answer is (C). \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (C).",
