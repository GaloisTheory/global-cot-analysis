  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by breaking down each option.\n\nGreek Orthodox Christianity is one of the oldest Christian traditions. They have a lot of rituals, icons, and liturgical practices. They emphasize tradition and the sacraments, so I don't think they're known for being stripped down. They probably have a rich ceremonial life.\n\nRoman Catholicism is another major denomination. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a structured hierarchy. The Pope is their leader, and they have various rituals and practices. Again, they're not typically seen as stripped down. They have a lot of ceremonial aspects and a complex structure.\n\nNow, the Puritans. I remember that the Puritans were a group within the Anglican Church in the 16th and 17th centuries. They wanted to purify the church of Catholic practices, so they emphasized simplicity in worship. They rejected elaborate rituals and focused on personal piety, reading the Bible, and a more direct relationship with God. This sounds like a stripped-down approach. They believed in a simpler form of Christianity, without the excesses of Catholicism. So maybe the Puritans are the answer here.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends. They are known for their simplicity in worship, not using formal sermons, and emphasizing inner light. They have a very plain style of worship, no clergy, and focus on direct communication with God. They also value simplicity and humility. So Quakers might also fit the description of stripped-down Christianity.\n\nWait, so both Puritans and Quakers are possibilities. But the question is about a denomination. Quakers are a denomination, and Puritans were a group within the Anglican Church, but they later formed their own congregations. However, the term \"Puritans\" is often used to refer to the movement rather than a single denomination. But the options are given as (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. So I need to choose between them.\n\nThe key here is the term \"stripped-down.\" The Puritans were known for rejecting elaborate church ceremonies and rituals, advocating for a simpler form of worship. Quakers also emphasize simplicity, but they are more associated with a specific form of worship that doesn't involve traditional church structures. However, the question might be looking for the Puritans as the answer because they are more directly associated with stripping down the church practices, such as rejecting Catholic traditions and simplifying services. Alternatively, Quakers are also known for their simplicity, but maybe the Puritans are more aligned with the idea of stripping down Christianity as a movement.\n\nAnother angle: The Puritans were part of the Reformation, aiming to purify the Church of England from Catholic practices. They wanted a more direct, simplified form of Christianity. Quakers, on the other hand, were a separate movement that emerged later, emphasizing spiritual equality and simplicity. But both are associated with simplicity.\n\nHowever, the question might have a specific answer. Let me check some key points. The Puritans are often cited as promoting a stripped-down version of Christianity, focusing on personal faith and rejecting ceremonial aspects. Quakers also have that, but perhaps the term \"stripped-down\" is more commonly linked to the Puritans. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Quakers because they have a very plain form of worship without any formal structure, which could be seen as stripped down.\n\nWait, but the options are (C) Puritans and (D) Quakers. Which one is more correct? I think the Puritans are more associated with stripping down the church's practices, while Quakers are known for their simplicity in worship but not necessarily as a movement to strip down Christianity. However, the answer might be Quakers because they are known for their simplicity and lack of formal rituals. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (C) Puritans because they were part of the Protestant Reformation and focused on simplifying worship.\n\nI need to be careful here. Let me think again. The Puritans wanted to purify the church, so they were against the Catholic practices and wanted a simpler form. Quakers, while also simple, have a different origin. The question is about a denomination. Quakers are a denomination, and Puritans were a group. But the options include both. So which is more likely? I think the answer is (C) Puritans. However, some sources might say Quakers. But I think the Puritans are more directly associated with promoting a stripped-down form of Christianity. Therefore, the answer is (C).\n",
