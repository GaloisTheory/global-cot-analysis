  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"stripped-down Christianity\" means. That probably refers to a simpler form of Christianity with less emphasis on rituals, ceremonies, or hierarchical structures. It might focus more on personal faith and scripture rather than tradition or church bureaucracy.\n\nLet me consider each option. \n\nGreek Orthodox is known for its rich traditions, liturgical practices, and emphasis on icons and sacraments. They have a complex structure with a hierarchy, so maybe not the answer.\n\nRoman Catholic Church has a lot of rituals, sacraments, and a centralized authority. They also have a lot of traditions, so maybe not stripped down either.\n\nPuritans were a group in the 16th and 17th centuries, mainly in England. They wanted to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity, personal Bible study, and a direct relationship with God. They rejected elaborate rituals and focused on preaching and personal piety. This sounds like stripped-down Christianity.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, also emphasize simplicity, inner light, and personal experience of God. They don't have a formal clergy, and their services are often unstructured. They might also fit the description. But I'm not sure if they are considered a denomination or a separate group. Also, the term \"stripped-down\" might be more associated with Puritans in the context of Protestant reformations.\n\nWait, the question is about denominations, so Quakers are a denomination. But which one is more known for stripped-down? The Puritans were part of the Protestant movement, advocating for a simpler form of worship. Quakers also have a simpler structure, but maybe the Puritans are more associated with stripping down the church's practices. \n\nAnother angle: \"stripped-down\" could relate to rejecting elaborate church structures. Both Puritans and Quakers did that. However, the Puritans were more focused on reforming the Church of England, while Quakers were a separate movement. \n\nLooking up some history: Puritans wanted to simplify worship, remove Catholic elements, and focus on scripture. They were known for their plain dress, simple worship, and emphasis on personal faith. Quakers also rejected formal religious structures, but they might have different origins. \n\nSo between C and D. The question might be looking for Puritans as the answer. Quakers are sometimes considered more radical, but maybe the term \"stripped-down\" is more commonly linked to Puritans in the context of Protestant denominations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D Quakers. Wait, but Quakers are sometimes referred to as \"the Friends\" and their meetings are very simple. However, the Puritans are a specific denomination (though they were a movement within Protestantism). \n\nWait, the answer choices are denominations. The Puritans weren't a single denomination but a movement. However, in the options given, (C) is Puritans. So maybe the answer is (C). Alternatively, Quakers are a denomination. \n\nBut which one is more associated with stripped-down Christianity? The Puritans are known for their emphasis on simplicity, plainness, and rejecting ceremonial aspects. Quakers also have a stripped-down approach. However, the term \"stripped-down\" might be more aligned with the Puritan movement. \n\nI think the answer is (C) Puritans. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check again. The Puritans were part of the Protestant Reformation, seeking to purify the Church of England from Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting elaborate rituals. Quakers are another group that rejected formal structures, but maybe the Puritans are more directly associated with the concept of stripped-down Christianity. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (C).\n",
