  "cot_content": "\nOkay, so the question is asking which Christian denomination promotes a stripped-down Christianity. The options are Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Puritans, and Quakers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these denominations is known for. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nGreek Orthodox is a branch of Eastern Christianity. They have a lot of traditions, rituals, and liturgical practices. They use icons, have a hierarchical structure with the Patriarch, and emphasize tradition and the sacraments. So I don't think they are known for being stripped down. They might have a rich tradition, so maybe not the answer.\n\nRoman Catholic Church is the largest Christian denomination. They have a lot of traditions, sacraments, and a structured hierarchy with the Pope. They also have a lot of rituals and practices. But I'm not sure if they are considered stripped down. Maybe not, since they have a lot of ceremonial aspects.\n\nPuritans... Wait, the Puritans were a group in 16th-17th century England. They were part of the Protestant Reformation. They wanted to purify the Church of England from Catholic practices. They emphasized simplicity in worship, rejecting things like elaborate rituals, music, and even some sacraments. They focused on personal piety, scripture, and a direct relationship with God. They might be considered as promoting a stripped-down form of Christianity. \n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, are another Protestant group. They emphasize inner light, simplicity, and community. They don't have a formal hierarchy, and their meetings are often unstructured. They also value simplicity in their worship, but I'm not sure if they are the same as Puritans. \n\nSo comparing Puritans and Quakers. The Puritans were more focused on reforming the Church of England and rejecting Catholic practices, leading to a more simplified form of worship. Quakers, while also valuing simplicity, might have different roots. The question is about a denomination that promotes stripped-down Christianity. \n\nThe Puritans were known for their emphasis on simplicity in worship, rejecting things like elaborate ceremonies, which fits the idea of stripped-down. The Quakers also have a simple form of worship, but maybe they are more associated with a different movement. \n\nSo between the options, the Puritans (C) would be the answer. The other options are more traditional or have more rituals. The Quakers are also simple but maybe not as directly associated with the term \"stripped-down\" as the Puritans. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be (C) Puritans.\n",
