  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the question is about genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and how much of the variation in body mass index (BMI) they explain, even though there's a high heritability from twin and family studies. The answer choices are percentages: 5%, less than 1%, 13%, or less than 2%.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about GWAS and heritability. Heritability refers to the proportion of variation in a trait that can be attributed to genetic differences. Twin studies often show high heritability for BMI, like over 50%. But GWAS, which look for associations between genetic variants (SNPs) and traits, have been found to explain a smaller proportion of the variance. \n\nWait, so even though there's a high heritability, the actual SNPs identified through GWAS might not account for all of that. This is sometimes called the \"missing heritability\" problem. But the question isn't about missing heritability; it's about how much variation is explained by known SNPs. \n\nI remember reading that GWAS for BMI have found around 100 or more SNPs associated with BMI, but the total variance explained is relatively low. For example, some studies might say that the top SNPs explain about 1-2% of the variance. But I need to check the exact numbers. \n\nLooking up some sources in my memory: A 2010 study by Speliotes et al. found that the SNPs they identified explained around 1-2% of BMI variation. Another study from 2018 or 2019 might have updated this, but I think the figure is still in the range of less than 5%, but maybe more precise. Wait, but the answer options include \"only 5%\", \"less than 1%\", \"only 13%\", and \"less than 2%\". \n\nWait, 13% seems higher. Maybe that's the total from all SNPs? Or maybe some studies have found higher percentages. But I think the commonly cited number is around 1-2%, which would fall into \"less than 2%\". But wait, I need to be careful. \n\nAnother angle: the heritability is around 50-70% from twin studies, but the SNPs explain less. For example, if the heritability is 50%, but the SNPs explain only 1-2%, that suggests that there's a lot of missing heritability. However, some sources might say that the total explained variance is around 13% if considering all SNPs, but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is 13%? Let me think. In a study published in 2018, a meta-analysis of GWAS for BMI found that the top SNPs accounted for about 13% of the variance. Wait, but that seems higher. Alternatively, maybe the answer is \"only 5%\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"less than 1%\". I need to recall specific numbers. For example, a 2010 study found that the SNPs identified explained about 1-2% of the variance. So \"less than 2%\" would be correct. However, other studies might have found higher numbers. \n\nBut the answer options include \"only 5%\" and \"less than 2%\". Which is more accurate? Let me think again. The initial GWAS for BMI were in the 2000s, and the variance explained was in the 1-2% range. Later studies, like the one that included more SNPs, might have increased that number. For example, the 2018 study by Locke et al. (the UK Biobank study) found that the SNPs explained about 13% of the variance. Wait, that would make \"only 13%\" an option. But I need to verify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe that's the total explained by all SNPs, but not sure. Let me think. If the heritability is 50%, and the SNPs explain 13%, that's a big gap. But maybe the 13% is from all the SNPs identified. However, the question says \"known SNPs\" which might refer to the ones identified in GWAS. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"only 5%\", but I'm not sure. Wait, I think the correct answer is \"less than 2%\". But I'm a bit confused because different studies might have different numbers. \n\nWait, let me check my memory. The original GWAS for BMI (Speliotes et al., 2010) found that the SNPs they identified explained about 1-2% of the variance. However, more recent studies, such as those combining data from larger cohorts, might have increased this number. For example, a study published in Nature in 2018 (Locke et al.) found that the top SNPs accounted for about 13% of the variance. However, that study might have considered more SNPs. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"known SNPs explain ______ of the variation in body mass index despite the evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies.\" So if the heritability is over 50%, but the SNPs explain only 1-2%, that's a big gap. However, if the answer is 13%, that would be a larger portion, but still not explaining all the heritability. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is \"only 5%\". I think that's a common figure cited in the literature. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is \"less than 1%\". \n\nWait, I need to recall specific numbers. Let me think of a study. For example, the 2010 study by Speliotes et al. in Nature Genetics found that the SNPs they identified explained about 1.5% of the variance. Another study might have found that the cumulative effect of all SNPs is around 5%. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be \"only 13%\", as some later studies might have found that. However, I think the more commonly cited number is around 1-2%, so \"less than 2%\" would be correct. But I'm not 100% sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"only 13%\", but I need to check. \n\nWait, if the answer choices include \"only 13%\", and the question is from a textbook or a standard question, maybe that's the intended answer. However, I might be mixing up different studies. \n\nAlternatively, let me think about the options again. The answer is likely \"less than 2%\" or \"only 5%\". But I need to decide. \n\nI think the correct answer is \"less than 2%\", but I'm not entirely confident. However, based on the 2010 study and some other sources, the number is around 1-2%, which would be \"less than 2%\". Therefore, the best answer is (D) less than 2%.\n",
