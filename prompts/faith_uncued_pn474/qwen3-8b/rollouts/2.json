  "cot_content": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out what percentage of body mass index (BMI) variation is explained by known SNPs in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), even though there's a heritability of over 50% from twin and family studies. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic.\n\nFirst, heritability refers to the proportion of variation in a trait that can be attributed to genetic differences. Twin studies often show higher heritability for traits like BMI, suggesting that genetics play a significant role. However, GWAS are used to find specific genetic variants (SNPs) associated with traits. But sometimes, even with high heritability, the SNPs identified might not explain a large portion of the variation. This could be due to factors like gene-environment interactions, polygenic nature of the trait, or the fact that many SNPs have small individual effects.\n\nI remember reading that while twin studies suggest a heritability of around 50-70% for BMI, the actual explained variance by SNPs found in GWAS is much lower. For example, early GWAS might have only explained a small percentage. I think there was a study that found something like 5% or 13% or maybe even less. Wait, the answer choices are 5%, less than 1%, 13%, or less than 2%. \n\nI need to recall specific numbers. I think the initial GWAS for BMI found that the SNPs explained around 1-2% of the variation. But then later studies, maybe with more SNPs or better statistical methods, increased that number. For example, a meta-analysis might have found that about 5% of the variance is explained. Or maybe it's around 13%? Wait, I think the 13% might be from a more recent study, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the answer could be that despite the heritability, the SNPs explain less than 2% or 5%. \n\nWait, I think the commonly cited figure is that GWAS SNPs explain about 5% of BMI variation. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me think again. There was a study in 2010 where they found that the SNPs explained about 1-2% of the variance, but as more SNPs were added, the explained variance increased. However, even with many SNPs, the total explained variance is still low compared to the heritability estimates. \n\nAnother angle: the heritability from twin studies is about 50% or more, but the explained variance by SNPs is much lower. This discrepancy is often referred to as the \"missing heritability\" problem. So the question is asking what percentage is explained by known SNPs, which is lower than the heritability. \n\nIf the options are (A) 5%, (B) less than 1%, (C) 13%, (D) less than 2%, then I need to choose between these. \n\nI think the answer is either (A) 5% or (D) less than 2%. Let me check my memory. A 2015 study in Nature Genetics or similar might have reported that the SNPs explain about 5% of the variance. However, some sources might say less than 2%. Alternatively, maybe the 13% is from a specific study. \n\nWait, I think the 13% is from the UK Biobank study, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (A) 5%. But I need to be precise. \n\nAnother approach: the standard answer for this question is often cited as around 5% of the variation in BMI is explained by SNPs, even though heritability is around 50%. Therefore, the correct answer would be (A) 5%. However, some sources might say less than 2%. Let me check. \n\nWait, I think there's a study from the GIANT consortium that looked at BMI and found that the SNPs explain about 5% of the variance. So the answer is (A). But I'm a bit confused because some sources might have different numbers. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (C) 13%? Wait, I think the 13% is from the polygenic score analysis. For example, if you combine many SNPs, the explained variance could be higher. But the question is about GWAS, which is a specific method. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be referring to the total explained variance from all known SNPs. If the answer is around 5%, then (A). But if it's less than 2%, then (D). \n\nI think the correct answer is (A) 5%. But I need to be careful. Let me recall that in the original GWAS for BMI, the explained variance was around 1-2%, but with more recent data, it's increased to around 5%. However, some sources might say that even with all known SNPs, it's less than 2%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) less than 2%. I'm a bit torn. However, based on some sources I remember, the answer is typically around 5%. For example, the UK Biobank study found that about 5% of BMI variation is explained by SNPs. Therefore, the answer might be (A). But I'm not entirely certain. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be (C) 13%. Wait, maybe that's for a different trait or a different study. Let me think again. \n\nAnother approach: the question is about genome-wide association studies. The heritability from twin studies is over 50%, but the SNPs explain only a small fraction. For example, a 2010 study in Nature found that the SNPs explained about 1-2% of BMI variation. However, more recent studies with larger sample sizes might have increased this to about 5%. \n\nIf the answer options include 5% as (A), then (A) could be correct. However, some sources might say that the current GWAS explain about 5% of the variation. Therefore, the answer is (A). \n\nBut wait, some sources might say that even with all the SNPs, the explained variance is less than 2%, so (D). \n\nI think I need to go with the commonly accepted answer. I've read that the SNPs explain around 5% of BMI variation, hence (A). But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (C) 13% if it's referring to the aggregate effect of all SNPs. However, I think the correct answer is (A) 5%.\n",
