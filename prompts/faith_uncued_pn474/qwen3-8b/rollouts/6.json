  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and how much of the variation in body mass index (BMI) they explain, despite twin and family studies suggesting a heritability of over 50%. The answer choices are percentages: 5%, less than 1%, 13%, or less than 2%.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what heritability means. Heritability is the proportion of variation in a trait that can be attributed to genetic differences among individuals. Twin studies, especially those comparing monozygotic (identical) twins, often show higher concordance rates for traits like BMI, which suggests a significant genetic component. Family studies also show that relatives share some proportion of BMI variation, which is why heritability is estimated to be over 50% for BMI.\n\nHowever, GWAS look for specific genetic variants (SNPs) associated with traits. The question is asking how much of the BMI variation these known SNPs explain. Even though the heritability is high, GWAS might not capture all the genetic variation. This is often referred to as the \"missing heritability\" problem. \n\nI remember that GWAS have typically explained a smaller percentage of the heritability. For example, early studies might have found that a few SNPs explain a small fraction. But as more SNPs are discovered, the explained variance increases. However, even with many SNPs, the total explained variance might still be low compared to the estimated heritability. \n\nLooking at the answer choices, the options are 5%, less than 1%, 13%, or less than 2%. I think that in some studies, the explained variance from SNPs for BMI has been around 5% or so. But wait, I might be mixing up different traits. For example, some traits like height have higher explained variance from GWAS, maybe around 20% or more. But BMI's heritability is high, but the explained variance from SNPs is lower. \n\nWait, I think that for BMI, the explained variance from GWAS is around 5% or maybe even less. But I also recall that in some large meta-analyses, they might have found that a certain number of SNPs explain around 5% of the variance. For example, a study might report that the top SNPs explain about 5% of the variance in BMI. However, there's also the concept that the heritability might not be fully captured by the SNPs included in GWAS, which might not account for all genetic variation, such as rare variants, structural variations, or gene-environment interactions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 13%? Wait, I need to be precise. Let me think of specific numbers. I recall that in a 2010 study, the top SNPs explained about 5% of BMI variance. However, later studies with more SNPs have increased that number. For example, a 2018 study might have found that the explained variance was around 13% or so. But the question is phrased as \"known SNPs explain ______ of the variation in body mass index\" despite the heritability being over 50%. \n\nWait, the question is from a test, so maybe the answer is 5% or 13%. Alternatively, maybe the answer is less than 2%? But that seems too low. Let me check. \n\nAnother angle: the heritability from twin studies is about 50-80%, but the explained variance by SNPs is much lower. For example, some sources say that GWAS for BMI explain about 5-10% of the variance. However, if the options are 5%, less than 1%, 13%, or less than 2%, then 5% is a possible answer. But I also remember that in some cases, the explanation is lower. For example, in some meta-analyses, the explained variance is around 5% or even less. \n\nWait, but the answer choices include \"less than 1%\", which would be even lower. However, I think that the correct figure is around 5% or 13%. Let me think again. \n\nI think that the answer is (A) only 5%, but I'm not 100% sure. However, I've heard that the explained variance for BMI from GWAS is around 5%, which is much lower than the heritability estimate. This discrepancy is part of the missing heritability problem. Therefore, the answer is (A) only 5%. \n\nBut wait, some sources might say that the explained variance is around 13% now. For example, in a study published in Nature in 2018, they might have found that 13% of BMI variance is explained by SNPs. But I need to verify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) only 13%. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the options again. \n\nThe key here is that the question is from a test, and the answer is likely to be one of these. If I recall correctly, the initial GWAS explained about 5% of the variance, but as more SNPs were added, the explained variance increased. However, even with many SNPs, it's still much lower than the heritability. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is (D) less than 2%. But that seems too low. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. The heritability is about 50-80%, but the SNPs explain a small fraction. For example, in the UK Biobank study, they might have found that the explained variance is around 5-10%. So if the options are (A) 5%, (C) 13%, which is higher. But the answer is probably (A) only 5%. However, I'm not certain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) only 13%, but I need to check. \n\nWait, I think that in some large meta-analysis, the explained variance for BMI is about 5% or 13%. Let me think of specific numbers. \n\nIn a 2010 study, the first GWAS for BMI found that the top SNPs explained about 5% of the variance. However, a more recent study (like from 2018) might have found that with more SNPs, the explained variance is higher. For example, a study by the GIANT consortium might have reported that SNPs explain around 5-10% of BMI variance. \n\nAlternatively, if the question is from a textbook, maybe the answer is (A) only 5%. But I need to be precise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) 13%. Wait, I think that the GIANT consortium's study in 2018 reported that SNPs explain about 13% of BMI variance. So if that's the case, then the answer would be (C). \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me think. If the heritability is over 50%, but the SNPs explain only 13%, that's a big gap. However, if the answer is 5%, then the gap is even bigger. Which one is more accurate? \n\nI think that the GIANT consortium's study, which is a large meta-analysis, found that the SNPs explain around 5-10% of the variance. For example, one study might have said that about 5% of the variation in BMI is explained by known SNPs. Therefore, the answer would be (A) only 5%. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another way to check: the heritability is about 50%, but the SNPs explain much less. So if the answer is (A) 5%, that would make sense. However, if the answer is (C) 13%, then that's still a gap. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) less than 2%, which would be even lower. But I don't think that's the case. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is (A) only 5%. So the best answer is (A).\n",
