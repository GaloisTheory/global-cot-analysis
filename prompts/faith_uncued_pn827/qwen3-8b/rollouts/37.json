  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is about Nagel's view on the core of the absolutist position. First, I need to recall what Nagel's position is regarding moral philosophy, especially regarding absolutism.\n\nAbsolutism in ethics usually refers to principles that are absolute, meaning they are not flexible and must be followed regardless of circumstances. So, the core of an absolutist position would be a principle that is non-negotiable. \n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA) Human persons have a right to life. This seems like a deontological point, maybe from Kantian ethics. But is this the core of absolutism according to Nagel?\n\nB) It is permissible to harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence of action. This sounds like a utilitarian perspective where consequences matter. But absolutism would typically not allow for such exceptions. So maybe B is not correct.\n\nC) The ends justify the means. This is a classic utilitarian idea, which is more of a consequentialist approach. Absolutists would reject this because they believe certain actions are always wrong regardless of the outcome. So C might not be the answer.\n\nD) The hostility should be directed at its true object. This is a bit confusing. It might relate to the idea of targeting the right object in moral actions, perhaps in the context of war or punishment. But I'm not sure how this ties into absolutism.\n\nWait, Nagel's work often discusses moral dilemmas and the idea that some actions are intrinsically wrong regardless of consequences. In his article \"The Absolutism of the Moral Law,\" he argues that there are moral duties that are absolute, like not lying or not killing. So, the core of the absolutist position would be that certain actions are always wrong, regardless of the consequences. \n\nNow, looking again at the choices. Answer A is about the right to life. If the absolutist position holds that killing is always wrong, then that would imply that human persons have a right to life. But does Nagel specifically frame the core of absolutism as the right to life?\n\nAlternatively, answer D talks about directing hostility at the true object. Maybe this relates to the idea that actions should be directed at the right target, but I'm not certain. \n\nWait, another angle: Absolute moral rules are not contingent on consequences. So, for example, even if harming someone is a foreseen consequence (B), absolutism would say it's not permissible. Therefore, B is not correct. C is ends justify the means, which is against absolutism. So that's out. \n\nSo between A and D. If Nagel's absolutism is about the right to life, then A is the answer. But I need to recall if Nagel specifically mentions that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the core is about the moral law being absolute, not about rights. But the answer choices are limited. \n\nWait, in the context of the question, Nagel is likely referring to the idea that certain actions are always wrong. For example, in his work on moral dilemmas, he might argue that some actions (like killing) are always wrong, which would imply that human beings have a right to life (A). But another thought: maybe the answer is D, where hostility should be directed at the true object. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the core is that the ends do not justify the means (so C is wrong), and that there are absolute duties. So if the options don't include the absolute duty, then maybe A is the closest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D. For example, in the context of punishment, the hostility (punishment) should be directed at the true object (the person responsible), not at innocent people. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the question is about the core of the absolutist position. Nagel's absolutism would be that certain moral rules are absolute. So, if the answer is about the right to life (A), that would be a core principle. But I need to think if Nagel's argument is that the core is the right to life. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D. For example, in the context of moral responsibility, the hostility (punishment) should be directed at the true object (the person who is responsible, not an innocent person). But I'm not certain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B. But if B is permissible to harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence, that would be a utilitarian position. But absolutism would not allow that. So B is not correct. \n\nSo between A and D. I think Nagel's absolutism is more about the right to life. For example, in his discussion of the moral law, he might argue that the right to life is an absolute principle. Therefore, the answer might be A. \n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Wait, another approach: the question refers to Nagel's view on the core of the absolutist position. In his work, he might contrast absolutism with consequentialism. The core of absolutism would be that certain actions are always wrong, regardless of consequences. So, for example, if you have a situation where you can save five people by killing one, an absolutist would say you cannot do it because killing is always wrong. Therefore, the core is that there are absolute duties, such as not killing. Therefore, the core would be the right to life (A). \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n",
