  "cot_content": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer choice correctly represents Nagel's view on the core of the absolutist position. Let me start by recalling what I know about Nagel and absolutist ethics.\n\nFirst, Thomas Nagel is a philosopher known for his work on moral philosophy, including his book \"The Possibility of Altruism.\" Absolutism in ethics typically refers to moral theories that hold certain principles as absolute, meaning they must be followed regardless of the consequences. For example, deontological ethics, like Kant's, is an absolutist position because it emphasizes duty and rules over outcomes.\n\nNow, the question is about the core of the absolutist position according to Nagel. Let me go through each answer choice.\n\nOption A: \"human persons have a right to life.\" This sounds like a deontological principle, which might be part of an absolutist stance. But is this the core? Maybe, but I need to check other options.\n\nOption B: \"it is permissible to harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence of action.\" Wait, absolutism usually says that certain actions are wrong regardless of consequences. If something is permissible even if harm is foreseen but unintended, that might not align with strict absolutism. For example, if you're following a rule that says you shouldn't lie, but lying leads to harm, but you didn't intend it, does that make it permissible? I'm not sure. Maybe this is more about consequentialism allowing unintended consequences, but absolutism would say that the act itself is wrong regardless of intent or outcome. So maybe B is not the core of absolutism.\n\nOption C: \"the ends justify the means.\" This is more of a consequentialist view, like utilitarianism, where the morality of an action depends on its outcomes. Absolutism would reject this, saying that certain means are always wrong, regardless of the ends. So C is likely not correct.\n\nOption D: \"the hostility should be directed at its true object.\" This seems like a principle about directing actions towards the right target, perhaps in the context of moral responsibility. But how does this relate to absolutism? Maybe if an action is justified only if it targets the right object, but I'm not certain. It might be part of a deontological framework, but not sure if it's the core of absolutism.\n\nWait, Nagel in his work on altruism discusses the idea that moral rules are absolute, and that we can't justify actions by their consequences. He might argue that the core of absolutism is that certain actions are wrong regardless of the outcome. However, the answer choices don't directly mention that. Let me think again.\n\nLooking back at the options, perhaps the key here is to recall Nagel's specific arguments. In his paper \"The Possibility of Altruism,\" Nagel argues against the idea that utilitarianism is the only moral framework. He suggests that there are absolute moral duties, such as the duty not to harm others. So, if an absolutist position holds that certain actions are always wrong, then maybe the core is about rights, like the right to life (option A). But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: if the question is about the core of the absolutist position, which Nagel might be critiquing, then perhaps the core is that the ends don't justify the means (so C is the opposite). But the question is about what Nagel thinks is the core of the absolutist position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe option D refers to something like targeting the right object, which could be part of a deontological framework. But I'm not sure. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the original question is about the core of the absolutist position. If absolutism holds that certain actions are always wrong, then the right to life (A) would be a specific example of an absolute principle. However, another possibility is that the core is about not allowing consequences to justify actions, which would relate to C being the opposite. But the answer options are about what Nagel thinks the core is. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Nagel is discussing the absolutist position as one that doesn't allow for exceptions, so the core is that certain rights are absolute. But without more context, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that in some contexts, absolutism might emphasize that the ends cannot justify the means (which would be C's opposite), so the core of an absolutist position is that the ends do not justify the means. However, the answer choice C is \"the ends justify the means,\" which would be the opposite. So if Nagel is arguing against that, then the core of the absolutist position would be that it's not permissible. But the question is about what Nagel thinks the core is. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D. If the absolutist position holds that hostility should be directed at the true object, meaning that you shouldn't target the wrong thing, which would align with certain deontological principles. For example, in moral philosophy, sometimes the idea is that actions should be directed at the right object, not the wrong one. But I'm not certain. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should look for which of these options is more aligned with Nagel's views. Since Nagel is known for his deontological approach, perhaps the core is about rights, like A. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the question refers to Nagel's critique of utilitarianism, which says that the ends don't justify the means, then the core of the absolutist position might be that the ends don't justify the means, making C the opposite. But the answer choices are about what Nagel thinks the core is. \n\nWait, the options are about what the core of the absolutist position is according to Nagel. If Nagel is discussing an absolutist position, then the core would be a principle that is absolute. For example, if it's a deontological position, then the core could be that certain actions are wrong regardless of consequences. So, perhaps the answer is A, because the right to life is an absolute principle. \n\nAlternatively, if the absolutist position is about the means not justifying the ends, then the core would be that the ends don't justify the means. But the answer choice C is the opposite. So if the absolutist position says the ends don't justify the means, then the core would be that, but that's not an option. Wait, the answer choices are (A)-(D). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is B, but I need to think again. If the absolutist position allows for harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence, that would be a consequentialist view. So that's not aligned with absolutism. \n\nSo, given that, maybe the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe D. \n\nWait, another angle: in Nagel's work, he discusses the idea that moral rules are absolute, so that certain actions are wrong regardless of outcomes. For example, he might argue that the right to life is absolute, so A. Therefore, I think the answer is A.\n",
