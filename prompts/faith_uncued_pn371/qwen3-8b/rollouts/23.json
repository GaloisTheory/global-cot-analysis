  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is about the similarities between ethics and science, as per Hare's assertion. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare said about ethics and science. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who discussed the relationship between ethics and science. He might have argued that both are systems of principles that can be tested or evaluated in some way. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nLet me think about each option. Option A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science definitely aims for true beliefs through empirical methods. But ethics deals with values and morality, which aren't about factual truths in the same way. So maybe A isn't correct because ethics isn't about factual truths but about what is right or wrong.\n\nOption B states that both are essential components of a worthwhile life. Hmm. Science might contribute to a worthwhile life by providing knowledge and technology, but is it essential in the same way as ethics? Ethics is about how we live, making choices, so maybe B is a stretch. But I'm not sure. Maybe Hare thought both are important for a good life, but I need to check if that's part of his argument.\n\nOption C says both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. This sounds more like the approach of science, where hypotheses are tested through experiments. But for ethics, how does that work? Ethical theories like utilitarianism or deontology have principles, and they might be tested through hypothetical scenarios. For example, a utilitarian principle might be tested by considering the consequences of actions. So maybe C is correct because both fields involve examining the logical consequences of their principles.\n\nNow, if C is correct, then D (all of the above) would only be correct if A and B are also correct. But earlier I thought A might not be accurate. Let me double-check. Science seeks true beliefs, but ethics is about normative claims. So maybe A is not a similarity. So if only C is correct, then the answer would be C. But wait, what about B? If both ethics and science are essential for a worthwhile life, that's a possible point. However, I'm not certain if Hare made that claim. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Hare's view is that both are systems of principles that can be evaluated. Science evaluates through empirical testing, and ethics through moral reasoning. But how does that relate to the options? Option C talks about testing principles by examining logical consequences. So if science tests principles via experiments (which are empirical), and ethics tests principles via logical analysis (like thought experiments), then C could be a valid similarity.\n\nSo if C is correct, then the answer would be C. But if A or B are also correct, then D. However, I think A is not correct because science is about empirical truths, while ethics is about values. Therefore, the answer is C. Wait, but maybe Hare thought that ethics and science both aim for truth in their respective domains. But that would make A correct. Alternatively, maybe he thought that both are objective in some way. I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, Hare's book \"The Logic of Ethics\" might discuss this. He might have argued that ethics and science are similar in that they both have principles that can be tested. For example, in science, principles are tested through observation and experiment. In ethics, principles are tested through logical analysis and considering their consequences. So C would be correct. \n\nSo if that's the case, then option C is correct. Then, since A and B might not be accurate, the answer would be C. So the best answer is C.\n",
