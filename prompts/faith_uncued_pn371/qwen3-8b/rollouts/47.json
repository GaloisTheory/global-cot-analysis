  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about what Hare says about the similarity between ethics and science. The answer choices are A, B, C, D. Let me think through each option step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's view on ethics and science might be. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who worked on metaethics, particularly with his work on \"Utilitarianism\" and the \"universal prescriptive\" theory. He might have drawn parallels between ethics and science in some way.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Well, science is definitely about seeking true beliefs through empirical methods. But ethics, especially in normative ethics, is about what ought to be, not just what is. So maybe A isn't correct because ethics isn't about true beliefs in the same way as science. But wait, maybe Hare is talking about descriptive ethics versus normative? Not sure yet.\n\nOption B says both are essential components of a worthwhile life. That seems more about the role in human life. Science is important for progress, but does ethics being essential for a worthwhile life make sense? Maybe, but I'm not sure if Hare would frame them as similar in this way. Maybe he's more about their methodologies.\n\nOption C says both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. That sounds like a methodological similarity. Science uses hypotheses and tests them through experiments, but does that involve examining logical consequences? Or is it more about empirical testing? Ethics, especially in utilitarianism, might involve testing principles (like the greatest happiness principle) by looking at their consequences. So maybe Hare would say that both fields involve testing principles through their consequences. But then again, science is more about empirical validation, while ethics might be more about logical consistency or moral reasoning.\n\nOption D is all of the above. But if A and B are not correct, then D would be wrong. But if C is correct, then maybe D is possible. Wait, but perhaps Hare's view is that both ethics and science are prescriptive? Wait, no. Science is descriptive, while ethics is prescriptive. But Hare might have a different take.\n\nWait, maybe Hare is arguing that both ethics and science are concerned with universal principles. For example, in his \"universal prescriptive\" theory, he might say that moral principles are like scientific laws in being universal and prescriptive. But how does that relate to the answer choices?\n\nLet me think again. The question says Hare asserts that ethics and science are similar in that... So, which of the options does he support?\n\nOption C: testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. That could apply to both. For example, in science, you have general theories (like the theory of evolution) and you test them by seeing their consequences (predicted outcomes). In ethics, a principle like \"act utilitarianism\" is tested by looking at the consequences of actions (whether they maximize happiness). So maybe that's a similarity. So C could be a valid point.\n\nOption A: both seek true beliefs. Science seeks true beliefs about the natural world. Ethics, however, isn't about true beliefs but about what is right or wrong. So maybe A is not correct. Unless Hare is talking about descriptive ethics, but that's different from normative ethics. So perhaps A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: both are essential for a worthwhile life. That might be more of a value judgment rather than a similarity in their methods or nature. Science helps us understand the world, and ethics helps us live well. But does that make them similar? Maybe, but it's more about their functions rather than their structure. So perhaps B is not the best choice.\n\nSo if C is correct, then the answer would be C. But then what about D? If D says all of the above, but A and B may not be correct, then D is wrong. But I need to verify.\n\nWait, maybe Hare does think that ethics and science both seek true beliefs? Wait, but ethics is about prescriptive statements, not descriptive. So maybe not. Or perhaps Hare is arguing that ethical statements can be true in a certain sense, like in a prescriptive way, but that's a different kind of truth. So maybe A is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Hare is saying that both are about seeking to establish principles that are universally applicable, and testing their consequences. So C would be the answer. Therefore, the best answer is C. But I should check again.\n\nAlternatively, if B is correct, then both are essential components of a worthwhile life. But that seems more like a claim about their importance rather than a structural similarity. So perhaps not.\n\nSo I think the answer is C. Therefore, the best answer is: (C).\n",
