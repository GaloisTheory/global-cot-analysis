  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this question. The question is about what Hare says about ethics and science being similar. The answer choices are A, B, C, D. So first, I need to recall what Hare's views are on this topic.\n\nWait, Hare is referring to R.M. Hare, right? He's a philosopher known for his work on metaethics, like the \"universal prescriptivism\" and the idea that moral statements are \"commands\" that are universal. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics. Let me think.\n\nThe question states that Hare asserts ethics and science are similar in that... So the key here is to find the commonality between ethics and science according to Hare. Let me consider each option.\n\nOption A says both seek to provide true beliefs about the world. Wait, science is about empirical truths, but ethics isn't about factual truths in the same way. Ethics deals with values and norms. So maybe Hare doesn't think ethics is about true beliefs in the same sense as science. But I'm not certain. Maybe Hare has a different view on this?\n\nOption B claims both are essential components of a worthwhile life. That sounds a bit more like a philosophical stance. But I'm not sure if Hare would say that. Science is about understanding the world, while ethics is about living rightly. But perhaps both contribute to a good life? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the main similarity Hare points out.\n\nOption C says both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. Hmm. In science, you have theories and test them through experiments, but also logical consistency. In ethics, maybe when you propose a moral principle, you check its logical consequences. For example, if you say \"Acting in a way that maximizes happiness is good,\" you might look at the consequences of that principle. Hare's work on prescriptivism might involve this. He might argue that ethical principles are evaluated for their logical consistency and consequences, similar to how scientific theories are. So maybe C is a good candidate.\n\nOption D is all of the above. But if A and B are not correct, then D would be wrong. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, earlier I thought science seeks true beliefs, but ethics is about prescriptive statements, not descriptive. So maybe A is not correct. Then B, whether they are essential components of a worthwhile life—maybe that's more of a utilitarian or hedonistic view. But Hare's focus might be more on the structure of ethical statements rather than their role in a good life. \n\nSo if C is the correct one, then the answer would be C. But I need to confirm if Hare indeed says that both ethics and science involve testing general principles by their logical consequences. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Hare compares them in terms of their methodological approach. For example, both might involve formulating general principles and then testing them through reasoning or empirical evidence. That seems plausible. So C might be the right answer. Therefore, the best answer is (C).\n",
