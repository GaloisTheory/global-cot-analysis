  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the similarity between ethics and science according to Hare. The options are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's views are. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who worked on ethics and meta-ethics. He proposed a \"universal prescriptivism\" theory, which is part of his moral philosophy. But how does that relate to science?\n\nThe question is about similarities between ethics and science. Let's break down each option.\n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science does aim for true beliefs through empirical methods. But ethics is more about norms and values, not just factual truths. However, Hare might have a specific take here. Wait, maybe he considers ethics as a system of principles that can be tested, similar to scientific theories. But does that mean they both seek true beliefs? Maybe not exactly, because ethics deals with what ought to be, not just what is. So A might not be correct.\n\nOption B states both are essential components of a worthwhile life. That's a bit vague. Science contributes to knowledge, and ethics guides behavior. But does Hare say they are both essential for a good life? I'm not sure. It might be a possible answer, but I'm not certain.\n\nOption C mentions testing general principles by examining logical consequences. Science does test theories through experimentation and logical consistency. Ethics, especially in a prescriptive sense, might involve logical analysis of principles. Hare's work might involve examining the logical consequences of moral principles. So maybe C is correct. But does Hare say that ethics and science are similar in this way?\n\nOption D says all of the above. If any of the options are incorrect, D would be wrong.\n\nWait, Hare's theory might have elements where he compares ethics to science. For instance, he might argue that ethical statements can be treated similarly to scientific ones in terms of their logical structure. But does he say they both seek true beliefs (A)? Or that they both involve testing principles through logical consequences (C)? Also, B's claim about being essential components of a worthwhile life might be more of a value judgment, not a similarity in method or structure.\n\nI think Hare's main point is that ethics can be analyzed in terms of logical structure, similar to scientific theories. So testing principles by logical consequences (C) would be a similarity. But does he also say they both seek true beliefs? Science seeks true beliefs, but ethics might not necessarily. Ethics could be prescriptive, not descriptive. So A might not hold. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be C. But I need to check if Hare specifically says this. If the question is about a similarity where both involve testing principles through logical consequences, then C would be correct. If B is also correct, then D would be the answer. However, I'm not sure if B is a valid point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Hare argues that both are essential for a worthwhile life. But that seems more like a normative claim rather than a structural similarity. \n\nGiven that, the best answer might be C. But I need to be careful. Let me think again. Hare's \"Prescription\" and \"Universal Prescriptivism\" involve the idea that moral statements are prescriptive, but they can be analyzed logically. So testing principles by examining logical consequences (C) would be a similarity. \n\nSo the answer is C. But wait, if D is all of the above, then maybe A and B are also correct. However, I'm not sure about A. Science seeks true beliefs, but ethics might not. So A might not be correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Hence, the best answer is (C).\n",
