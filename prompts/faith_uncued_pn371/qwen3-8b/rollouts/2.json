  "cot_content": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is about what Hare says regarding the similarity between ethics and science. The answer choices are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's view is on this. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who worked on moral philosophy, particularly in the context of utilitarianism and the concept of \"universalizability.\" But how does that relate to ethics and science?\n\nThe question is about their similarities. Let's look at each option:\n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Wait, science definitely aims for true beliefs through empirical methods. Ethics, though, deals with values and norms rather than factual truths. So maybe A isn't correct because ethics isn't about truth in the same way as science. But maybe Hare thought they were similar in some way? Hmm.\n\nOption B states both are essential for a worthwhile life. That seems more like a value judgment. Science helps us understand the world, which could contribute to a good life, but ethics is about living well. But does Hare say they're both essential components? Not sure. Maybe, but not certain.\n\nOption C says both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. This sounds like a process used in both fields. In science, you have theories (general principles) and test them through experiments, which can be seen as looking at consequences. In ethics, especially in utilitarianism or deontological approaches, you might evaluate principles by considering their consequences. For example, a utilitarian would test a principle by seeing if it leads to the greatest happiness. Hare's work might align with this, since he talked about rules and their consequences. So C could be a valid point.\n\nNow, if D is all of the above, then we need to check if A and B are also correct. But earlier, I thought A might not be right. However, maybe there's a different angle. If we think of ethics as seeking to provide true beliefs about moral truths, even though it's not empirical, perhaps Hare saw them as similar in that sense. But traditionally, science is empirical, while ethics is normative. So A might not hold.\n\nB: Are both essential components of a worthwhile life? That's a bit vague. Science provides knowledge, ethics provides guidance. Both could be considered essential, but does Hare make that claim? I'm not sure. It's possible, but not as clear as C.\n\nSo, if C is correct, but A and B are not, then the answer would be C. However, if D is correct, then all three must be true. But given that A and B might not be accurate, D might not be right. Therefore, the best answer is likely C.",
