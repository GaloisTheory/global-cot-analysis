  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this question. The question is about Hare's assertion that ethics and science are similar in some way. The answer choices are A, B, C, and D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare said. I think Hare was a philosopher who worked on ethics, maybe related to utilitarianism or something like that. Wait, he's known for his work on moral philosophy, particularly in the context of utilitarianism. But how does that connect to science?\n\nThe question is about similarities between ethics and science. Let me think about each answer choice.\n\nOption A says both seek to provide true beliefs about the world. Science definitely aims for true beliefs through empirical evidence and experimentation. But ethics is about moral principles, right? So does ethics seek true beliefs? Maybe not in the same way. Ethics deals with what is right or wrong, not necessarily factual truths. So maybe A isn't correct.\n\nOption B states both are essential components of a worthwhile life. Hmm. Science is important for understanding the world, but is it essential for a worthwhile life? Some people might argue that ethics is more directly related to a worthwhile life because it's about how we live and make decisions. But science could also be seen as essential for a good life through technology and knowledge. However, I'm not sure if Hare would say they are both essential components. Maybe B is not the best answer.\n\nOption C says both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. Wait, science does this. For example, scientific theories are tested by their predictions and logical consequences. In ethics, when we use utilitarianism, we test principles by seeing what the consequences would be. So maybe both fields use logical consequences to evaluate their principles. That sounds plausible. So C could be a correct answer.\n\nNow, looking at D, which is all of the above. If A and B are not correct, then D would be wrong. But I need to check again. \n\nWait, for A, maybe Hare thinks that both ethics and science aim for truth, but in different domains. Science seeks truth about the natural world, and ethics seeks truth about moral truths. But if \"true beliefs about the world\" is interpreted broadly, maybe ethics is also about true beliefs about moral truths. But I'm not sure if Hare would agree. Some philosophers argue that ethics is not about truth in the same way as science. So maybe A is not correct.\n\nFor B, if both are essential components of a worthwhile life, maybe Hare thinks that science provides the knowledge needed for a good life, and ethics provides the moral guidance. But I'm not certain. However, I think Hare's main point is about the methodological similarity. \n\nSo if C is correct, but A and B are not, then the answer would be C. But if D is correct, then all three are right. But I need to think if all three are correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Hare argues that both ethics and science involve rational inquiry. For example, science uses logical reasoning and testing, and ethics also uses reasoning to determine moral principles. But the answer choices don't mention rational inquiry directly. \n\nWait, the answer choice C says both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. That's exactly what I was thinking earlier. In science, you have theories (general principles) and you test their consequences. In ethics, like in utilitarianism, you test the consequences of actions to see if they are morally right. So that's a similarity. \n\nSo if C is correct, and A and B are not, then the answer is C. But let me check again. \n\nOption A: Do both seek true beliefs about the world? Science does, but ethics is about moral truths, not necessarily about the world. So A might not be correct. \n\nOption B: Are both essential components of a worthwhile life? Maybe, but I think Hare's focus is more on the methodological similarity rather than their role in life. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.\n",
