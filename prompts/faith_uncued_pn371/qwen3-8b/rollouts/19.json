  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about what Hare asserts regarding the similarity between ethics and science. The answer choices are A, B, C, or D. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare said about ethics and science. I remember that Hare, in his work, particularly in \"The Logic of Ethics,\" discussed the relationship between ethics and science. He might have argued that both fields are concerned with general principles and their application. Wait, but let's be precise.\n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science, of course, aims for true beliefs by testing hypotheses and seeking empirical evidence. But ethics is more about norms and values rather than factual truths. So maybe A isn't correct because ethics isn't about factual truth but about what ought to be.\n\nOption B states they are essential components of a worthwhile life. That seems more like a value judgment. Science provides knowledge, and ethics provides moral guidance. But are they both essential for a good life? Maybe, but I'm not sure if Hare focused on that aspect. He might have talked more about the structure of their methodologies.\n\nOption C says both involve testing general principles by examining logical consequences. That rings a bell. Hare might have argued that ethics, like science, involves formulating general principles (like moral rules) and then testing their logical consequences. For example, in ethics, you might take a principle like \"do no harm\" and see what follows from it. Similarly, in science, you take a theory and see what predictions it makes. So this seems like a key point. \n\nNow, looking at the options again. If A is not correct, and C is correct, then D (all of the above) would be wrong. But I need to check if B is correct. If B is correct, then D would be correct. But I'm not certain about B. Let me think again. Hare might have emphasized that both are about principles and their logical consequences. So C is likely correct. \n\nBut what about A? Science is about true beliefs, but ethics is about what is right or wrong, not necessarily about factual truth. So A might not be a correct similarity. Therefore, C is the right answer. But let me check if Hare said that both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. \n\nYes, Hare's work does compare ethics and science in terms of their methodological similarities. He argues that ethical principles are not just given but are to be tested for consistency and logical consequences, much like scientific theories. So C is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. So the best answer is (C).\n",
