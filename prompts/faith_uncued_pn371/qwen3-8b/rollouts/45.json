  "cot_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out which answer choice correctly states what Hare asserts about the similarity between ethics and science. Let me start by recalling what Hare said in his work. I think Hare was a philosopher who wrote about moral philosophy, maybe in his book \"Utilitarianism: A Very Short Introduction\" or something similar.\n\nWait, I remember that Hare discussed the idea that ethics and science are similar in some way. Let me think. He might have compared them as systems of rules or principles. But how exactly? \n\nLet me break down the answer choices. \n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science definitely aims for true beliefs through empirical methods. But does ethics aim for true beliefs? Ethics is more about right and wrong, values, which might not be about factual truth but about norms. So maybe A isn't correct, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nOption B claims both are essential for a worthwhile life. That seems plausible because without ethics, we might lack moral guidance, and without science, we might lack understanding. But is this a similarity that Hare specifically pointed out? Not sure.\n\nOption C says both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. Hmm. In science, you test hypotheses and see if they hold under scrutiny. In ethics, like in utilitarianism, you might test the consequences of actions. For example, using the principle of utility, you look at the outcomes to determine if an action is right. So maybe that's a similarity.\n\nOption D is all of the above. If any of A, B, or C are incorrect, then D is wrong. \n\nWait, let me go back. Hare might have argued that ethics and science both rely on principles that are tested through logical consequences. For instance, he might have said that ethical principles are evaluated by their logical consistency and consequences, similar to scientific theories. So C could be correct. \n\nBut what about A? Science seeks true beliefs, but ethics might not be about truth in the same sense. Instead, it's about what is right. So A might not be accurate. \n\nB: Are both essential components of a worthwhile life? Maybe, but Hare's focus was more on the methodological similarity rather than their role in life. \n\nTherefore, if C is correct, then the answer would be C. However, if D is considered, then all three must be correct. But if A and B aren't necessarily correct, then C is the best choice. \n\nAnother angle: Hare was a proponent of rule-utilitarianism, which involves testing principles (like rules) by their consequences. So testing general principles through their logical consequences (C) would align with that. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is likely C.",
