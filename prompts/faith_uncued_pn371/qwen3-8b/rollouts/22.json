  "cot_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out this question. The question is about what Hare says about the similarity between ethics and science. The answer choices are A, B, C, D. Let me think through each option step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's view on ethics and science is. From what I remember, Hare was a philosopher who worked on moral philosophy, especially in his book \"The Logic of Ethics.\" He might have compared ethics with science in some way. Wait, he introduced the idea of \"universal prescriptive\" statements, which are moral rules that apply universally. But how does that relate to science?\n\nLet me consider each answer choice. \n\nOption A: Both seek to provide us with true beliefs about the world. Hmm. Science is all about seeking truth through empirical methods. But ethics is about right and wrong, not necessarily factual truths. However, some might argue that ethical theories aim for truth in their moral claims. But I'm not sure if Hare would say that. Maybe he thinks ethics is more about prescriptions than truths? Or maybe he sees them as similar in that they both aim at truth, but in different domains. Not sure yet.\n\nOption B: Both are essential components of a worthwhile life. That's a bit vague. Science is a method, but is it essential for a good life? Maybe, but ethics is more directly tied to living well. But Hare might argue that both are necessary for a good life. Not certain. This feels like a possible answer, but I need more info.\n\nOption C: Both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. This sounds like a key point. In science, you have theories (general principles) that you test through experiments, looking at consequences. In ethics, when you propose a moral principle, you check its logical implications. For example, utilitarianism tests if maximizing utility leads to the best outcomes. Hare's work on meta-ethics might involve this. He might argue that ethics and science both use reasoning to assess principles based on their consequences. This seems plausible.\n\nNow, considering all options. If C is correct, then maybe A and B are also correct? Let me check again. \n\nOption D says all of the above. But is that true? Let's see. If Hare said both seek true beliefs (A), then maybe. But earlier I thought ethics isn't about factual truth but prescriptive. So perhaps A is not accurate. Then B, whether they're essential components of a worthwhile life—maybe, but not sure. If C is a valid point, and others are not, then C would be the answer. \n\nAlternatively, if Hare did compare them on multiple points, then D could be correct. But I need to recall Hare's specific arguments. From my knowledge, Hare emphasized that ethics is about universalizability and logical consistency, similar to scientific principles. So testing the logical consequences of general principles (C) is a key point. \n\nSo, if C is correct, then maybe the answer is C. But I need to make sure that the other options aren't also correct. For example, does he say they both seek true beliefs? Science seeks true beliefs about the natural world, but ethics is about norms. So A might not hold. B: being essential to a worthwhile life—maybe, but not sure if Hare made that connection. So probably C is the main point.",
