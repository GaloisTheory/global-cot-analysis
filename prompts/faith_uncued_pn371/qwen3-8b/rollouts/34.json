  "cot_content": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The question is asking what Hare asserts about the similarity between ethics and science. The answer choices are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's views are on this. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who worked on moral philosophy, particularly in his book \"The Foundations of Ethics.\" He proposed a theory called \"universal prescriptivism,\" which relates to how moral statements are similar to scientific ones.\n\nSo, the question is about similarities between ethics and science. Let me think about each option.\n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Wait, science does aim for true beliefs by testing hypotheses and seeking empirical truths. But ethics is more about prescriptive statements—what we ought to do rather than descriptive facts. So maybe ethics isn't about true beliefs but about norms. So A might not be correct.\n\nOption B states both are essential components of a worthwhile life. Hmm, science is about understanding the world, while ethics is about living well. But does Hare say they're both essential? I'm not sure. Maybe he thinks they both contribute to a good life, but I need to check if this is his point.\n\nOption C: Both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. This rings a bell. In science, you have theories that are tested through logical consequences and experiments. In ethics, Hare's approach involves looking at moral principles and their implications. For example, he might argue that moral rules should be evaluated based on their logical consistency and consequences, similar to how scientific theories are tested. So this seems like a possible correct answer.\n\nOption D is all of the above. But if A or B are not correct, then D would be wrong. \n\nSo, going back. If Hare thinks that ethics and science are similar because they test principles by examining logical consequences (C), then that's a key point. But what about A and B?\n\nFor A, science seeks true beliefs, but ethics is about prescribing actions. However, Hare might have a different take. He might argue that moral statements are prescriptions, but there's a similarity in how they are structured. Wait, maybe he sees them as similar in terms of methodological aspects. For example, both use reasoning and testing. But the first part about true beliefs might not apply to ethics. So A might not be correct.\n\nAs for B, whether they are essential components of a worthwhile life. Science helps us understand the world, which can contribute to a good life, and ethics guides our actions. But I'm not sure if Hare specifically said that both are essential components. \n\nTherefore, if C is correct, then the answer is C. But wait, the question is about what Hare asserts. Let me think again. In Hare's work, he did compare ethical statements to scientific ones. He suggested that moral statements are prescriptive, but they function similarly in terms of being rules that can be tested. For instance, in \"The Foundations of Ethics,\" he discusses how moral principles can be subjected to logical analysis, similar to scientific principles. Therefore, testing general principles by examining their logical consequences (C) is a similarity. \n\nSo, given that, C is likely correct. Then, if A and B aren't necessarily correct, the answer is C. But maybe D is correct if all are right. However, I don't think A is right because ethics isn't about true beliefs but about prescriptions. So the best answer is C.",
