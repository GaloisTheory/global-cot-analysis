  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is about what Hare says about the similarities between ethics and science. The options are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's view is on this. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who worked on moral philosophy, maybe related to utilitarianism? Wait, he's known for his work on the \"universal prescriptive\" theory and the idea that moral statements are prescriptions rather than descriptions. But how does that relate to science?\n\nThe question is about the similarity between ethics and science. Let me think. The options are about what they both seek, components of a worthwhile life, testing principles by logical consequences, or all of the above.\n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science is about finding true beliefs through empirical methods. But ethics is more about prescriptive statements, right? Like \"you should do X\", not just \"X is true\". So maybe A is not correct because ethics isn't about true beliefs in the same way science is. So A might be incorrect.\n\nOption B says both are essential components of a worthwhile life. Hmm. Well, science is important for understanding the world, which can contribute to a worthwhile life. Ethics is about living morally, which is also part of a worthwhile life. So B might be a possible answer. But I'm not sure if Hare specifically said this. Maybe this is more of a general statement rather than something Hare specifically noted.\n\nOption C says both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. That sounds more like how science works, using logic and testing hypotheses. But ethics, especially in deontological or utilitarian frameworks, also involves considering the consequences of actions. Wait, but does Hare say that? Hare's work on the \"universal prescriptive\" might involve logical consequences. For example, in his theory, moral rules are tested for their logical consistency and consequences. So maybe C is correct.\n\nWait, the original question is about what Hare asserts. So I need to check if Hare's work specifically compares ethics and science in these ways. I think Hare's main point was that moral statements are prescriptive, not descriptive, so they aren't about truth in the same way scientific statements are. Therefore, A might not be correct. But perhaps he thought that both science and ethics involve testing principles. For example, science tests theories by their logical consequences and empirical evidence, and ethics might test moral principles by their logical consequences (like in utilitarianism, the consequences of actions are considered). So maybe C is correct.\n\nThen, D says all of the above. But if A is incorrect, then D is wrong. But if B is correct, then maybe D is possible. However, if B is not something Hare said, then D is not correct.\n\nWait, the question is about what Hare asserts. So I need to think about his specific arguments. Hare's \"The Logic of Ethics\" discusses the logical structure of moral statements. He might have argued that both ethics and science involve logical reasoning and testing of principles. For example, in science, you have theories that are tested by their logical consequences and empirical predictions. In ethics, moral principles are tested by their logical consistency and consequences. So C could be correct. \n\nBut what about B? If both are essential components of a worthwhile life, that's a bit more of a value judgment. Maybe Hare didn't focus on that aspect. \n\nSo maybe the correct answer is C. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if both seek true beliefs (A), but ethics isn't about true beliefs in the same way, so A is incorrect. Then B and C? But if B is not something Hare said, then C is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Hare thought that both ethics and science are about finding general principles, testing them, so C is correct. Therefore, the answer might be C. But I need to be careful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D. If all three are correct, but I'm not sure about B. If B is correct, then D would be. But I'm not certain. I think Hare's main point was about the logical structure and testing of principles, so C. Therefore, the best answer is C.\n",
