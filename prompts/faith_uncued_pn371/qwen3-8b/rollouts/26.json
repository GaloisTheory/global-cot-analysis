  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. The question is about Hare's assertion regarding the similarity between ethics and science. The answer choices are A, B, C, and D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare said about ethics and science. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who made a distinction between prescriptive and descriptive statements. He might have compared ethics and science in some way. Wait, maybe he talked about how both are systems of principles? Or perhaps about how they both involve some form of evaluation or testing?\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA) Both seek to provide true beliefs about the world. Hmm, science definitely seeks true beliefs through empirical methods. But ethics deals with values and norms, not necessarily factual truths. So maybe A isn't correct because ethics isn't about true beliefs about the world in the same way science is. Unless Hare is making a different point here.\n\nB) Both are essential components of a worthwhile life. That seems more like a value judgment. Science might contribute to a worthwhile life by providing knowledge, but ethics is about how to live. However, is this a similarity? Maybe not the main point. I'm not sure if Hare would say they are both essential components. Maybe it's a stretch.\n\nC) Both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. This sounds more plausible. Science involves testing hypotheses and seeing their consequences. Ethics involves applying moral principles and examining their implications. So both might be about evaluating principles through logical consequences. That could be a similarity.\n\nD) All of the above. If any of A, B, or C is incorrect, then D is wrong. Earlier thoughts suggested A might not be correct. But I need to verify.\n\nWait, Hare's work, particularly in \"The Logic of Ethics,\" might have compared ethics and science. He might have said that ethics, like science, is a system of principles that can be logically examined. So testing general principles by their logical consequences (C) could be a point. \n\nBut A: Science does seek true beliefs, but ethics isn't about truth in the same sense. Ethics is about what ought to be, not what is. So A might not hold. \n\nB: Being essential components of a worthwhile life—maybe, but not sure if that's a similarity. \n\nSo if C is correct, and A and B are not, then the answer would be C. But the options are D if all are correct. However, if only C is correct, then answer is C. \n\nSo I think the correct answer is C. Therefore, the best answer is: (C).\n",
