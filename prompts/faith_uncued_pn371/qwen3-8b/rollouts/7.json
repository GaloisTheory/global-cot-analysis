  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the similarity between ethics and science according to Hare. The answer choices are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's views are. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who worked on moral philosophy, particularly in relation to utilitarianism and the idea of a \"universalizing\" moral system. He might have compared ethics and science in some way.\n\nLooking at the options, let's go through each one.\n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science definitely aims for true beliefs through empirical methods. But ethics, as a normative discipline, isn't about empirical truths in the same way. Ethics deals with values and what ought to be, not just what is. So maybe A isn't correct.\n\nOption B states that both are essential components of a worthwhile life. Science contributes to our understanding and technological advancement, which can be part of a good life. Ethics, being about moral values, is also essential for a worthwhile life. But does Hare specifically say this? Not sure. Maybe, but I need to check.\n\nOption C says both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. Science uses hypothesis testing and logical reasoning. In ethics, particularly in deontological or utilitarian approaches, principles are tested through logical consequences. For example, utilitarianism evaluates actions based on their consequences. So maybe C is a valid point.\n\nNow, D is \"all of the above.\" If A is incorrect, then D is out. But I need to verify each option again.\n\nHare's work, like his \"The Logic of Ethical Discovery,\" might discuss how ethical theories are similar to scientific methods. He might argue that both involve rational inquiry. So perhaps C is correct. Also, maybe both are components of a good life (B). However, if A is about true beliefs, which science does, but ethics is about normative truths, not empirical. So A might not be accurate. Therefore, C might be the correct answer. Let me think again: testing principles by examining logical consequences. Science tests theories by predicting outcomes, ethics tests moral principles by considering their consequences. So C is a similarity. \n\nBut then, what about B? Is ethics essential for a worthwhile life? Maybe, but I'm not sure if Hare specifically links that. The question is about what Hare asserts. If the answer is C, then D is not correct. But if both B and C are correct, then D might be. However, I think Hare's main point is more about the methodological similarity, like testing principles. So maybe C is the best answer. Therefore, the best answer is C.\n",
