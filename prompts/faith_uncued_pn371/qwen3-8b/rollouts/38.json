  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is about the similarity between ethics and science, as stated by Hare. The answer choices are A, B, C, D. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare said about ethics and science. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who wrote about the naturalistic fallacy and the relationship between ethics and science. He might have drawn some parallels between the two.\n\nLet me think about each answer choice. \n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science definitely aims for true beliefs through empirical evidence. But ethics deals with moral values, which aren't about factual truth in the same way. So maybe A isn't correct. But I'm not sure. Maybe Hare thought they both aim for truth in some sense?\n\nOption B claims both are essential for a worthwhile life. Science is important for understanding the world, but ethics is about living well. But does Hare say that both are essential components? I'm not certain. Maybe he considered both as necessary for a good life, but I need to check.\n\nOption C states both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. Science does this, like testing theories through hypotheses and logical consequences. Ethics, especially in normative ethics, involves looking at the consequences of actions or principles. For example, utilitarianism looks at the consequences of actions. So maybe C is correct. \n\nHare's work on the logical structure of ethics might link them. He might have said that both fields involve evaluating principles through their logical outcomes. \n\nNow, looking at the options again. If A is about truth, but ethics isn't about empirical truth. So A might not be right. B is about being essential components of a worthwhile life. Maybe both are important, but I'm not sure if that's the main point. C seems more about the method of testing principles through logical consequences. \n\nHare might argue that both science and ethics involve examining the logical consequences of principles. For example, in science, a theory must hold under logical scrutiny and empirical testing. In ethics, a moral principle must be logically consistent and have consequences that are considered. \n\nSo, if C is correct, then D (all of the above) would only be correct if A and B are also correct. But I'm not sure about A and B. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Science seeks true beliefs (A), but ethics is more about norms and values. So A might not be accurate. So maybe C is the correct answer. \n\nBut then, if B is also correct, then D would be possible. However, I think B is more about the role in a worthwhile life. Hare might not have said that both are essential components. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. So the answer should be (C).\n",
