  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. The question is about what Hare says is similar between ethics and science. The answer choices are A, B, C, D. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's views on ethics and science are. I remember that Hare is a philosopher who worked on moral philosophy, particularly in the area of meta-ethics. He's known for his work on utilitarianism and the idea of \"universalizing\" moral principles. But I'm not exactly sure how that connects to science.\n\nWait, the question says that ethics and science are similar in some way. Let me think about the answer choices again.\n\nOption A: Both seek to provide us with true beliefs about the world. Hmm. Science is all about seeking true beliefs through empirical evidence, right? But ethics is about moral beliefs, which are more about what is right or wrong, not necessarily about factual truths. So maybe A isn't correct because ethics isn't about true beliefs in the same way science is. Ethics is more about norms and values rather than factual truths.\n\nOption B: Both are essential components of a worthwhile life. That seems more like a value judgment. Science and ethics are both important in life, but does that make them similar in the way Hare would say? I'm not sure. Maybe Hare would agree, but I need to think if this is a similarity he points out. I think this might not be the key point. Maybe the similarity is more about methodological aspects rather than their role in life.\n\nOption C: Both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. This sounds more like a methodological similarity. In science, when you have a theory (a general principle), you test it by looking at consequences, like predictions. In ethics, like in utilitarianism, you might test a moral principle by seeing what consequences it would have. Hare might argue that both fields use logical consequences to evaluate their principles. So this could be a point of similarity.\n\nOption D: All of the above. If A, B, and C are correct, then D would be the answer. But earlier I thought A might not be correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, Hare's work on ethics includes the idea of \"universal prescriptivism,\" where moral statements are prescriptive. But does he think that ethics and science both seek true beliefs? Science seeks true beliefs about the natural world, but ethics is about what we ought to do. So maybe A isn't the right choice. However, some might argue that both are about truth, but in different domains. But Hare might not agree with that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that both involve testing principles. In science, you test theories by their predictions. In ethics, you might test moral principles by their consequences. For example, a utilitarian would test a moral rule by looking at its outcomes. So C might be correct.\n\nSo if C is correct, then B and A would need to be evaluated. If B is correct, that both are essential components of a worthwhile life, but I'm not sure if that's a similarity Hare would highlight. Maybe he considers both as necessary for a good life, but the question is about similarity in their nature, not their role in life. \n\nSo maybe the answer is C. Therefore, the best answer is (C). But wait, let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe D is correct. If all three are true. But I'm not sure about A and B. If Hare says that both seek true beliefs, then A would be correct. But I think that's a point of contention. Science seeks true beliefs about the world, but ethics is about ought, not is. So A might not be accurate. \n\nTherefore, perhaps only C is correct. So the answer would be (C). But I need to make sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Hare argues that both are concerned with principles and their consequences. So C is correct. Therefore, the answer is (C).\n",
