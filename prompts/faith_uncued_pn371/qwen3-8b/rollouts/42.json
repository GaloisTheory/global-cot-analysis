  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about what Hare says is similar between ethics and science. The answer choices are A, B, C, D. Let me think through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's view on ethics and science is. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who wrote about moral philosophy, particularly in his work \"The Logic of Ethics.\" He might have drawn parallels between ethics and science in some way. \n\nLet me consider each option. \n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Well, science definitely aims for true beliefs by testing hypotheses and seeking empirical evidence. But ethics is more about norms and values, not just factual truths. So maybe A isn't correct. Wait, but Hare might have a different take. Maybe he considers ethics as a system of principles that are rationally justified, similar to scientific principles. But I'm not sure if \"true beliefs\" applies here. Ethics is about what ought to be, not just what is. So maybe A is not the right answer.\n\nOption B states they are essential components of a worthwhile life. Science and ethics both contribute to a good life, but is that their similarity? Science helps us understand the world, while ethics guides our actions. But does Hare say they are both essential components? I'm not certain. Maybe B is a possible answer, but I need to check other options.\n\nOption C claims both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. This sounds more like a similarity. Science involves testing theories through experiments and logical deductions. Ethics, in some frameworks, like utilitarianism, involves testing principles (like the greatest happiness) by examining their consequences. Hare might argue that ethical principles are evaluated by their logical implications, similar to scientific theories. So C could be correct. \n\nNow, looking at D, which is all of the above. If A, B, and C are all correct, then D would be the answer. But I need to verify each point again. \n\nFor A: If ethics is about true beliefs, but ethics is more about oughts rather than is. So maybe A isn't correct. However, Hare might have a different perspective. Wait, Hare's moral philosophy is more about rationality and logical structure. He might argue that ethical principles are tested similarly to scientific ones. But does that mean they seek true beliefs? Not sure. \n\nOption B: If both are essential for a worthwhile life, but is that a similarity? Science helps us understand the world, which is part of a good life, but ethics is about living well. However, Hare might not necessarily say that both are essential components. Maybe it's more about the methods they use. \n\nOption C seems more likely correct. So if C is correct, and others are not, then answer is C. But if A or B are also correct, then D. \n\nWait, let me check again. Hare's work: In \"The Logic of Ethics,\" he discusses the structure of ethical principles, comparing them to scientific theories. He might argue that ethics, like science, involves testing principles through logical analysis and consequences. So C would be correct. \n\nBut what about A? Science seeks true beliefs (empirical truths), but ethics is about moral truths, which are not empirical. So A might not hold. \n\nB: Are both essential components of a worthwhile life? Maybe, but that's more of a value judgment rather than a structural similarity. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. But wait, some sources might say that Hare considers ethics and science similar in that they both involve testing principles through logical consequences. So C is correct. \n\nSo the answer would be C. But I need to make sure. Let me think again: if Hare says that ethics and science are similar in that they both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences, that's C. So the answer is C. Therefore, the best answer is C.\n",
