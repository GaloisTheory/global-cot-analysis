  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about comparing ethics and science, specifically what Hare asserts they have in common. The answer choices are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare said about ethics and science. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who discussed moral philosophy, maybe in his book \"The Logic of Moral Concepts.\" He might have drawn parallels between ethics and science. Let me think... Oh right, he talked about how ethical principles can be tested similarly to scientific theories. \n\nSo, the options are: A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science does aim for true beliefs, but ethics is more about norms and values. Wait, but Hare might argue that ethics is about rationality and consistency, not just truth. Hmm. But maybe he sees ethics as similar to science in some way. \n\nOption B claims both are essential parts of a worthwhile life. That seems more like a value judgment. Science isn't directly about a worthwhile life, but ethics is. Not sure if this is correct. \n\nOption C says both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. That rings a bell. In science, you test hypotheses and see if they hold up logically or empirically. In ethics, Hare might say that moral principles should be tested logically. For example, if a moral principle leads to contradictions, it's rejected. This sounds like a similarity. \n\nOption D is all of the above. If A and B are incorrect, then D is wrong. But if C is correct, then maybe D is possible. Wait, earlier thoughts on A: does ethics seek true beliefs? Science seeks true beliefs, but ethics might not. Ethics is about what ought to be, not just what is. So A might not be correct. \n\nBut wait, Hare's approach could be different. He might say that ethics is about rationality, so perhaps both science and ethics involve seeking coherent principles. Maybe in his view, ethics is a system of principles that can be evaluated for consistency, similar to how scientific theories are evaluated. So C would be correct. \n\nIf B is not correct because science isn't necessarily part of a worthwhile life, then B is out. A is tricky. If Hare's point is about testing principles via logical consequences, then C is the answer. So the best answer would be C. Therefore, the answer is (C). \n\nWait, but what if D is correct? If A is also correct? Let me check again. Science seeks true beliefs, but ethics may not. However, in some contexts, ethical theories might aim for truths about moral facts. But Hare's position might differ. He might focus more on the structure of moral reasoning rather than truth. So A might not be accurate. Therefore, C is the best choice.",
