  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is about what Hare asserts regarding the similarity between ethics and science. The answer choices are A, B, C, D. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare said about ethics and science. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who worked on moral philosophy, particularly in the context of utilitarianism and the idea of \"universal prescriptivism.\" He also wrote about the nature of moral language and how it might relate to scientific concepts. \n\nThe question is asking for a similarity between ethics and science. Let's look at the options.\n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science is definitely about seeking true beliefs through empirical evidence and testing. But ethics is about moral principles and values. However, Hare might argue that ethics is a form of prescriptive rather than descriptive. So maybe A is not correct because ethics isn't about true beliefs about the world in the same way science is. But I need to check.\n\nOption B states both are essential components of a worthwhile life. I'm not sure. Science is a method of inquiry, and ethics is about living well. Maybe they are both important for a good life, but is that their similarity? Hare might not have focused on that aspect. Not sure yet.\n\nOption C says both involve testing general principles by examining logical consequences. Science does this through hypothesis testing and logical reasoning. Ethics, especially in utilitarianism, involves testing moral principles by considering their consequences. Hare might argue that ethical principles are tested by their logical consequences. So maybe C is correct.\n\nOption D says all of the above. If A, B, and C are correct, then D would be the answer. But I need to verify each.\n\nWait, Hare's work might emphasize that ethics and science both involve a form of rationality and testing. For example, in his book \"The Logic of Ethics,\" he might discuss how moral principles are evaluated similarly to scientific theories. So, perhaps C is correct. \n\nBut what about A? Science seeks true beliefs, but ethics is about what ought to be, not just what is. So A might not hold. However, Hare might have a different take. He might argue that ethical statements can be given a descriptive account, but that's more of a later development. \n\nOption B: If both are essential for a worthwhile life, that's more of a value judgment. But Hare might not have framed it that way. \n\nIf C is correct, then the answer would be C. But if both A and C are correct, then D would be the answer. However, I need to think about Hare's specific arguments. \n\nHare's main point in his work is that moral statements are prescriptive, not descriptive, but he also discusses the role of logical consequences in evaluating moral principles. So testing general principles by logical consequences (C) could be a similarity. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely C. But let me make sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D. But if A is not correct, then D is wrong. So if only C is correct, then C. But I'm not certain. \n\nWait, let me think again. Science seeks to provide true beliefs (A), and ethics seeks to provide moral truths. But Hare might argue that ethics is not about truth in the same sense as science. So A might not be correct. \n\nSo, the correct answer would be C. Therefore, the best answer is: (C).\n",
