  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about what Hare says about the similarity between ethics and science. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what Hare's views are. I think Hare is a philosopher, maybe related to utilitarianism or something like that. Wait, he's known for his work in meta-ethics, right? Like the \"universal prescriptivism\" or something. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.\n\nThe question is about the similarity between ethics and science. The options are about what they both seek, components of a worthwhile life, testing principles through logic, or all of the above.\n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science is about finding true beliefs through empirical methods. But ethics is about moral truths, which might not be about factual truths. Wait, but some people think ethics can be objective. But Hare might have a specific view here. If he's saying ethics is similar to science, maybe he thinks they both aim for truth. But I'm not certain. Maybe he sees them as different in that science deals with facts and ethics with norms. But the question is about similarity.\n\nOption B says both are essential components of a worthwhile life. Hmm, that's more about their role in life. But science and ethics are both important, but does Hare say they are components of a worthwhile life? I'm not sure. Maybe he's more focused on their methods or structure.\n\nOption C says both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. That sounds like a method of reasoning. Science uses hypotheses and tests them through experiments, but ethics might use logical analysis of principles. For example, in ethics, you might take a principle like \"act utilitarianism\" and see what consequences it leads to. So maybe Hare is saying that both fields involve this kind of logical testing. That seems plausible.\n\nNow, if D is \"all of the above,\" then I need to check whether all A, B, C are correct. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. \n\nIf Hare is comparing ethics and science, he might be pointing out that both are systems that aim for truth (A), but does that apply to ethics? Or is ethics more about prescriptive norms rather than descriptive truths? Then maybe A is not correct. But if he's using a naturalistic approach, maybe he thinks ethics can be grounded in scientific methods. \n\nAlternatively, if both fields involve testing principles through logical consequences (C), that's a methodological similarity. For example, in science, you test theories by their predictions; in ethics, you might test moral principles by their logical consistency or consequences. So C might be a valid point.\n\nOption B, about being essential components of a worthwhile life, seems more like a value judgment. Both science and ethics contribute to a good life, but is that a similarity Hare is pointing out? Maybe not. He might be more focused on their structure or methods.\n\nSo, if A is not correct, then the answer might be C. But if Hare thinks both seek true beliefs (A), then that could be part of it. I'm a bit confused here. Wait, maybe Hare is arguing that ethics is similar to science in that they both aim for objective truths, but in different domains. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, if he says that both involve testing principles by logical consequences, that's more about the methodology. So C could be the answer. Let me check if there's any known information about Hare's views. \n\nWait, I recall that Hare's \"The Logic of Ethics\" might discuss this. He might argue that ethics is a system of principles that are tested through logical analysis, similar to how scientific theories are tested. So C might be correct. \n\nBut then, does that make A also correct? If science seeks true beliefs about the world, but ethics seeks true moral beliefs, then A could be considered as both seeking true beliefs, just in different domains. So A might be true. However, if ethics isn't about true beliefs but about prescriptions, then A is incorrect. \n\nThis is tricky. I need to decide. If the answer is C, then that's about testing principles through logical consequences. But if Hare's view includes that both seek true beliefs (A) and both test principles (C), then D would be correct. But I'm not certain. \n\nWait, another angle: science is about empirical testing, while ethics is about normative principles. But Hare might argue that both are rational systems. However, the question is about what Hare asserts. If I can't recall specifics, maybe I should go with the most likely answer. \n\nLooking up Hare's views, he is known for his work on meta-ethics, particularly in distinguishing between \"prescriptivist\" and \"descriptive\" ethics. He might argue that both",
