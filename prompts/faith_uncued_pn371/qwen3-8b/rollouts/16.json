  "cot_content": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is about what Hare says about the similarity between ethics and science. The answer choices are A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's views were. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who worked on moral philosophy, maybe related to utilitarianism. Wait, he wrote \"The Logic of Ethics\" or something like that. He might have compared ethics to science in some way. \n\nSo the question is asking which of the options correctly states their similarity. Let me think about each option.\n\nOption A: Both seek true beliefs about the world. Science definitely aims for true beliefs through empirical evidence. But ethics is more about values and norms rather than factual truths. However, some ethical theories, like natural law or certain forms of utilitarianism, might claim to find objective truths. But I'm not sure if Hare would say that ethics seeks true beliefs in the same way as science. Maybe not. Because ethics deals with prescriptive statements, not just descriptive.\n\nOption B: Both are essential components of a worthwhile life. That seems more about the role they play in human life. Science helps us understand the world, and ethics guides our actions. But does Hare say they are both essential for a good life? I'm not certain. It might be possible, but I'm not sure if this is the main point he made about their similarity.\n\nOption C: Both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. This sounds more like a procedural similarity. In science, you test hypotheses and see what follows logically from them. In ethics, when you have a principle (like utilitarianism), you examine the consequences of applying it. So maybe Hare argued that both fields use logical analysis of principles. That rings a bell. I think Hare did compare ethics to science in terms of how they develop and test principles through reasoning.\n\nOption D: All of the above. If any of the previous options are incorrect, then D isn't right. But if all three are correct, then D would be the answer. But earlier thoughts suggested that A might not be accurate because ethics isn't about true beliefs in the same way as science. So perhaps C is the main point, making D incorrect. Alternatively, maybe Hare thought all three apply. \n\nWait, Hare's work might have focused on the methodological similarities. For example, he might argue that ethics is a system of rules that can be tested logically, similar to scientific theories. So testing general principles by looking at their logical consequences would be a similarity. That aligns with option C. \n\nBut then, does he also think they both seek true beliefs? Maybe in a different sense. Science seeks true beliefs about the physical world, while ethics seeks true beliefs about moral truths. But if he sees them as similar in methodology, then maybe A is not the right choice. \n\nAlternatively, if ethics is about finding correct principles (which are true in a normative sense), then maybe A could be considered. But I think the key difference is that science is about descriptive truths, while ethics is about prescriptive ones. Therefore, A might not be correct. \n\nSo focusing back on C: testing principles by their logical consequences. That seems like a better fit. So if C is correct, then D (all of the above) would only be correct if A and B are also correct. But if A is not, then D is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is also a valid point. But I'm not sure. Let me check my memory again. Hare's work on ethics, especially his \"Utilitarianism\" or his approach to moral philosophy, might emphasize the logical structure and testing of principles. So he might agree that both ethics and science involve examining logical consequences of principles. \n\nTherefore, if C is correct, then the answer is C. But maybe the original question's correct answer is D. Wait, maybe I need to consider that Hare actually said all three. But I'm not confident. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D. Let me think again. If ethics and science both aim for true beliefs (A), even if in different domains, then maybe Hare would include that. Science seeks true beliefs about the world, ethics seeks true beliefs about the moral world. Then A would be correct. \n\nIf B is also correct, that both are essential for a worthwhile life, then D would be the answer. But I'm not sure if Hare emphasized that. \n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should look up Hare's actual work. But since I can't do that, I'll rely on what I remember. \n\nI think Hare's main point was about the logical structure of ethics, comparing it to science. So, testing general principles by their logical consequences (C) is the key similarity. Therefore, C is correct. \n\nBut if A and B are also correct, then D would be the answer. However, I think A might not be accurate because ethics is not about true beliefs in the same way as science. Science deals with empirical truth, while ethics deals with normative truths. So A is not correct. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.",
