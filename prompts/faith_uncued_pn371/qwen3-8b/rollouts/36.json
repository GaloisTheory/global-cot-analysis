  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. The question is about what Hare says about the similarity between ethics and science. The answer choices are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's view is. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who discussed the relationship between ethics and science. He might have argued that ethics is a system of rules that can be analyzed similarly to scientific principles. Wait, but what exactly did he say about their similarities?\n\nLet me think. One of the key points Hare made was that ethical statements can be treated as prescriptive, similar to how scientific statements are descriptive. But the question here is about the similarity between ethics and science in terms of their methodologies or goals. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. But wait, science is about seeking true beliefs about the natural world. Ethics, on the other hand, is about what ought to be, not just what is. So maybe A is not correct because ethics isn't about true beliefs in the same way science is. But maybe Hare thought that ethical truths are also about true beliefs? I'm a bit confused here. Maybe Hare thought that ethical principles are not just subjective but have a kind of objective validity, so maybe A is possible.\n\nOption B says both are essential components of a worthwhile life. Well, science is essential for understanding the world, and ethics is essential for living a good life. But is that a similarity? The question is about similarity in their structure or method, not their role in life. So maybe B is not the right answer. But I'm not sure. Maybe Hare thought that both are necessary for a good life. But I think this might be more of a value judgment rather than a structural similarity.\n\nOption C says both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. That sounds like a method used in both fields. Science tests theories by predicting outcomes and checking if they hold. In ethics, when you have a moral principle, you might test its logical consequences to see if it leads to contradictions or desirable outcomes. For example, if a moral rule leads to a contradiction when applied, it might be rejected. So maybe Hare thought that both fields use this method of logical analysis. \n\nSo, if C is a correct similarity, then perhaps A and B are not. Let me check again. \n\nOption D says all of the above. But if A and B are not correct, then D would be wrong. But I need to verify each option.\n\nHare's main point was that ethics is a system of rules that can be analyzed using logical methods, similar to how scientific theories are analyzed. He might have argued that ethical principles are not just subjective but can be evaluated for consistency and logical consequences. That would support option C. \n\nBut what about option A? Science seeks true beliefs about the world (scientific truths), whereas ethics is about what ought to be. However, Hare might have thought that ethical truths are also a kind of \"true\" in the sense that they are prescriptive and have objective validity. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe A is incorrect because ethics isn't about factual truths but about normative truths. \n\nOption B: Both are essential components of a worthwhile life. That's more of a value statement. Science helps us understand the world, and ethics helps us live well. But is that a similarity in their structure? Maybe not. The question is about similarity in their methods or nature. \n\nTherefore, if C is correct, and A and B are not, then the answer would be C. However, if Hare did argue that both seek true beliefs (as in A), then that might be part of it. But I think the key similarity Hare pointed out is the method of testing principles through logical consequences, which is option C. \n\nSo the best answer is C.\n",
