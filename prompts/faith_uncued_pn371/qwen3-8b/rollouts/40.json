  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the similarity between ethics and science according to Hare. The options are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare said about ethics and science. Wait, I think Hare was a philosopher who compared ethics with science. I remember that he might have argued that ethics is similar to science in some aspects. Let me think.\n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science definitely aims for true beliefs through empirical methods. But ethics deals with values and norms, not just facts. So maybe A isn't correct because ethics isn't about factual truth but about moral truths. But wait, maybe Hare thought of ethics as a system that could be tested? Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nOption B suggests both are essential for a worthwhile life. That seems more like a value judgment. Science provides knowledge, which is important, and ethics guides living well. But is that a direct similarity? Maybe Hare didn't frame it that way. Not sure if this is the right answer.\n\nOption C states both involve testing general principles by examining logical consequences. That sounds like a methodological similarity. Science uses hypothesis testing and logical reasoning. Ethics might involve applying principles (like utilitarianism) and looking at consequences. Hare might have thought that ethical theories are tested by their logical consequences, similar to scientific theories. This seems plausible.\n\nNow, considering all options. If C is correct, then D (all of the above) would be possible only if A and B are also correct. But earlier thoughts made me uncertain about A and B. Let me check again. \n\nWait, Hare's work, \"The Logic of Moral Concepts,\" might argue that ethics is a prescriptive system, while science is descriptive. But he might have drawn parallels in how they form and test principles. For example, science tests theories through experiments; ethics tests principles through logical analysis. So C could be correct. \n\nRegarding option A: Science seeks true beliefs about the world, but ethics seeks to determine what is right or wrong. So A might not hold. But if Hare considered moral truths as akin to scientific truths, maybe A is included. However, I think the key point here is that both involve testing principles through logical consequences. \n\nTherefore, if C is correct, then D depends on A and B. If A and B are not correct, then the answer is C. But if Hare did say both seek true beliefs (A), then D. Alternatively, perhaps he considers that ethics and science both aim to provide coherent systems. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B is incorrect because while science contributes to a worthwhile life, ethics is central to it. But the question is about similarity. \n\nI'm leaning towards C being the correct answer. Therefore, the best answer is C. Wait, but the original question says Hare asserts that ethics and science are similar. If Hare's argument includes that both involve testing principles via logical consequences, then C is correct. \n\nSo, after considering, I think the answer is C.\n",
