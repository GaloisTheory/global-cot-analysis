  "cot_content": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is about what Hare says about the similarity between ethics and science. The answer choices are A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's view on ethics and science might be. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who worked on meta-ethics, particularly with his theory of universal prescriptivism. He also wrote about the relationship between science and ethics. \n\nSo, the question is asking for a similarity between ethics and science. Let me think about each option.\n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Well, science does aim for true beliefs through empirical methods. But ethics is more about norms and values rather than factual truths. However, some might argue that ethical theories also seek to provide true beliefs about moral facts. But I'm not sure if this is the main point Hare makes.\n\nOption B states both are essential components of a worthwhile life. Science contributes to our understanding and improving life, but ethics is about how we should live. Maybe both are important for a good life, but does Hare make this comparison? I'm not certain. It might be a possible answer, but I need to check other options.\n\nOption C suggests both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. That sounds more like a method. Science uses hypothesis testing and logical reasoning. Ethics, especially in normative ethics, involves evaluating principles (like utilitarianism) and their consequences. So maybe both use logical analysis of principles. This seems plausible. \n\nNow, considering Hare's work, he might argue that both fields have similar structures. For example, in \"The Logic of Ethics,\" he discusses how ethical principles can be tested similarly to scientific ones. He might compare the way ethical theories are evaluated through logical consistency and consequences, which would align with option C. \n\nBut then, looking at all options again, if C is correct, does that mean A or B are also correct? If A is about true beliefs, but ethics isn't necessarily about truth in the same way as science, which deals with empirical truth. So maybe A isn't accurate. Option B says they are essential for a worthwhile life. While both might contribute, is that a similarity Hare highlights? I think Hare's focus is more on the structure of ethical reasoning rather than its role in life's worthiness.\n\nSo, if C is correct, then D (all of the above) would only be correct if A and B are also true. But if A and B aren't, then C is the best choice. However, I need to be careful here. Let me think again. \n\nHare did argue that ethics and science share a similar methodology in terms of logical analysis and testing principles. For example, in his work, he discusses how ethical theories can be evaluated through logical consistency and consequences, similar to how scientific theories are tested. Therefore, option C seems to capture that. \n\nRegarding option A, while science seeks true beliefs, ethics is more about normative claims (what ought to be) rather than descriptive truths (what is). So A might not be correct. Option B, about being essential to a worthwhile life, is more of a value judgment rather than a structural similarity. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is likely C. However, I need to confirm if Hare actually made this specific comparison. Since I don't have the exact text, I'll go with what I know. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (C).",
