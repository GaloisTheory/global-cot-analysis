  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about what Hare asserts regarding the similarities between ethics and science. The answer choices are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's views are. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who worked on moral philosophy, particularly in the context of utilitarianism. He also wrote about the relationship between ethics and science. Wait, there's something about his work that compares ethics with science. \n\nLet me think. Hare might have argued that ethics is a system of rules that can be analyzed similarly to scientific theories. So maybe he thought that ethical principles are like scientific laws in that they can be tested and evaluated. But how does that relate to the answer choices?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Both seek to provide true beliefs about the world. Well, science does aim for true beliefs through empirical evidence. But ethics is more about what ought to be, not just what is. So maybe A isn't correct because ethics isn't about factual truths but about values. But I'm not sure if Hare would say that. Maybe he's saying that ethics, like science, is about seeking truth, but in a different domain. But the question is about similarity. So maybe A is not the right choice.\n\nB) Both are essential components of a worthwhile life. That seems more like a value judgment. Science and ethics both contribute to a good life, but is that a similarity? Maybe, but I'm not certain. Hare might have thought that both are necessary, but I'm not sure if that's his main point here.\n\nC) Both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. This sounds like a more direct comparison. In science, you have theories that are tested through experiments and logical consequences. In ethics, you might have moral principles that are tested by considering their implications. For example, a utilitarian principle would be tested by looking at its consequences. Hare might have argued that ethics, like science, is a rational system where principles are evaluated through their logical consequences. So this could be the correct answer.\n\nD) All of the above. But if A and B are not correct, then D is out. \n\nWait, but maybe Hare did think that ethics and science both seek true beliefs about the world. But science deals with factual truths, while ethics is about value judgments. However, some ethical theories, like naturalism, might try to ground ethics in facts. But Hare might have a different take. Alternatively, maybe he's saying that both science and ethics involve seeking truth, but in different domains. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Hare's point is that both are systematic, so testing principles through their consequences. So C might be the key. \n\nI need to recall Hare's specific argument. I think he discussed in \"The Logic of Ethics\" that ethics should be treated as a system of rules that can be logically evaluated, similar to science. He might have said that ethical principles are not just prescriptive but can be examined for their logical consistency and consequences. So C would be the correct choice. \n\nSo the answer would be C. But let me check the options again. If B is about being essential components of a worthwhile life, that's more of a value judgment, but maybe Hare would argue that both are necessary for a good life. However, I think the main similarity he emphasized is testing principles through their logical consequences. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (C).\n",
