  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this question. The question is about what Hare says about the similarities between ethics and science. The options are A, B, C, D, with D being all of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare's views are. I think Hare is referring to the \"universal prescriptivism\" in ethics, which is part of his work on moral philosophy. He might have compared ethics and science in some way. Let me break down the options.\n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science, of course, aims for true beliefs through empirical evidence. Ethics, though, is more about norms and values. But maybe Hare considers ethical statements as aiming for true beliefs in a different sense. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's a common point of comparison. Maybe he sees both as seeking truths, but in different domains. \n\nOption B says both are essential for a worthwhile life. Science helps us understand the world, which can contribute to a good life. Ethics guides our actions, which is also essential. But does Hare specifically say that both are essential components? I'm not certain. It might be a stretch, but maybe.\n\nOption C states both involve testing general principles by examining logical consequences. Science uses hypothesis testing and logical reasoning. In ethics, especially in deontological or rule-based theories, principles are tested for consistency. Hare's approach might involve looking at the logical consequences of ethical principles. For example, if a principle leads to contradictions or absurdities, it's rejected. So maybe this is a point where they are similar.\n\nNow, if I consider Hare's work, he might argue that both ethics and science are systematic ways of seeking truth. Science through empirical methods, ethics through rational analysis. So maybe A and C are both points. But B is about being essential components of a worthwhile life. Is that a common point? Maybe not necessarily. \n\nWait, the question says \"Hare asserts that ethics and science are similar in that\". So I need to recall specific points Hare made. I remember that Hare discussed the idea that ethical statements are prescriptive, but he also compared them to scientific statements in terms of their structure. For example, he might have said that both science and ethics involve testing principles through logical consequences. That would be C. \n\nAlternatively, if he thought both seek true beliefs (A), but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Because ethics is about what ought to be, not just what is. So maybe A is not correct. Then C would be the main point. \n\nIf C is correct, then D (all of the above) would be incorrect unless A and B are also correct. But if only C is correct, then the answer would be C. \n\nWait, another angle: Hare might have thought that both ethics and science are concerned with the truth of their claims. For example, in science, the truth is about the natural world, and in ethics, the truth is about moral facts. But that's a bit abstract. However, the key is how Hare specifically framed it. \n\nAlternatively, if he said that both involve examining the logical consequences of principles, that's a more direct comparison. So maybe C is the answer. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If Hare's argument is that ethics and science are similar in that they are both systems of principles that are tested through logical consequences, then C is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if he thought both seek to provide true beliefs (A), but that's more about the content of their claims. But science seeks true beliefs about the natural world, while ethics seeks true beliefs about moral truths. But maybe Hare sees them both as seeking truths in their respective domains. \n\nHowever, the question is about what Hare specifically asserts. If I can't recall exactly, but based on common philosophical comparisons, the similarity in testing principles through logical consequences (C) is a known point. For example, in ethics, you might test a principle by seeing if it leads to undesirable consequences. Similarly, in science, you test a hypothesis by seeing if its consequences align with observations. \n\nTherefore, I think C is the correct answer. But I need to check if A or B are also correct. \n\nOption B says both are essential for a worthwhile life. While that might be true, I don't think Hare specifically made that comparison. It's more about the methods of inquiry rather than their role in life. \n\nSo if only C is correct, then the answer is C. If all three are correct, then D. But I'm not sure about A and B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe A is correct. Science seeks true beliefs about the world (A), and ethics, in some sense, seeks true beliefs about moral truths. If Hare considered ethics as a system that aims for true moral beliefs, then A would be correct. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Given that, if the answer is C, then the answer is C. But if Hare thought both seek true beliefs (A), then perhaps A is also correct. \n\nWait, another thought. Hare's \"universal prescriptivism\" suggests that moral statements are prescriptive, but he also compared them to scientific statements in terms of their structure. For example, he might have said that ethical principles are tested by their logical consequences, similar to how scientific theories are tested. So C would be the similarity. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. But I need to check if A is also correct. If Hare said that both seek true beliefs (A), then that's another similarity. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Since I'm not 100% sure, but based on the options given, if C is a correct point, and others are not as clear, the answer is C. Therefore, the best answer is C.\n",
