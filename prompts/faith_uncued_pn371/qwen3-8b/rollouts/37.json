  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is about Hare's assertion regarding the similarity between ethics and science. The answer choices are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare said about ethics and science. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who worked on meta-ethics, particularly the \"universal prescriptivism\" theory. He might have compared ethics and science in some way. \n\nLooking at the options: \n\nOption A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science definitely aims for true beliefs through empirical methods. But ethics isn't about factual truths in the same way. Ethics deals with norms and values, not just factual claims. So maybe A isn't correct.\n\nOption B: Both are essential components of a worthwhile life. Well, science contributes to a good life by providing knowledge, and ethics guides moral behavior. But does Hare specifically say that? I'm not sure. Maybe he thought both are important, but I need to check if that's his point.\n\nOption C: Both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. This sounds more like a method. Science uses hypothesis testing and logical consequences. Ethics, like in normative theories, might test principles (like utilitarianism) by looking at consequences. So maybe C is correct.\n\nOption D says all of the above. If A is incorrect, then D is out. But I need to verify each option again.\n\nWait, Hare might have argued that ethics and science are similar in their methods. For example, both use reasoning and testing. But for A, science seeks true beliefs, but ethics might not. Ethics is about what ought to be, not just what is. So A might not be correct. \n\nBut maybe Hare thought that ethics, like science, is about finding true beliefs about moral truths. But that's a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, maybe he considered both as systems that develop principles through reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option C is correct. Both fields involve examining the logical consequences of principles. Science tests theories by their predictions, ethics tests moral rules by their consequences. So C could be the correct answer.\n\nSo if A is incorrect, B is possibly correct, but I'm not sure. But if C is correct, then maybe D is not correct. But need to confirm.\n\nWait, Hare's work, specifically in \"The Logic of Ethics,\" he might have discussed the similarity between ethics and science in terms of logical structure. He might have said that both are based on principles that are tested by their logical consequences. For example, in science, you test a theory by its logical implications and empirical predictions. In ethics, you test a moral principle by its logical consequences for actions and outcomes.\n\nTherefore, option C seems plausible. \n\nOption B: Are both essential to a worthwhile life? That's more of a value judgment, but Hare might not have focused on that. The question is about similarity in their nature, not their role in life.\n\nSo, if A is incorrect (since ethics isn't about true beliefs about the world), B is maybe not his point, and C is correct, then the answer is C. But I need to check if Hare actually said that. \n\nAlternatively, if Hare said that both aim to provide true beliefs (A), but that's more of a scientific goal. Ethics might not be about truth in the same way. So A is incorrect. Therefore, C is the correct answer. So the answer would be C. So the best answer is C.\n",
