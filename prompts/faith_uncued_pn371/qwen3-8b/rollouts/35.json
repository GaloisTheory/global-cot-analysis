  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the similarity between ethics and science, as per Hare's assertion. The answer choices are A, B, C, D. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare said about ethics and science. I remember that Hare was a philosopher who worked on meta-ethics, particularly the \"universal prescriptivism\" theory. He argued that moral statements are similar to scientific statements in some ways. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think. In his book \"The Logic of Ethics,\" Hare discussed the structure of ethical statements. He proposed that ethical statements are prescriptions, not just descriptions. But how does that relate to science? Maybe he compared the methods or the nature of their reasoning?\n\nLooking at the answer options. Option A says both seek true beliefs about the world. Science aims for true beliefs through empirical evidence. But ethics deals with values and norms, not necessarily factual truths. So maybe A is not correct. Wait, but Hare might have thought that ethical principles are like scientific theories in that they are tested logically. Hmm.\n\nOption B says both are essential components of a worthwhile life. That seems more about the role in life rather than their structure. Science helps us understand the world, ethics guides our actions. But does Hare say they are both essential for a good life? I'm not sure. Maybe B is a possible answer, but I'm not certain.\n\nOption C states that both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. That rings a bell. Hare's approach to ethics involved looking at the logical consequences of moral principles. For example, if a moral rule is \"you should not lie,\" we test its implications. Similarly, in science, we test theories by looking at their logical consequences and empirical predictions. So maybe C is correct.\n\nNow, checking D: all of the above. If A and B are correct, then D would be the answer. But earlier I thought A might not be right. Wait, science seeks true beliefs, but ethics is about what ought to be, not what is. So A might not be accurate. But Hare might have a different take. Maybe he thought that ethical statements are prescriptive but still involve seeking truth in the sense of logical consistency? Or maybe he considered that both are about truth in different domains.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Hare's point was that both ethics and science involve hypothetical imperatives. Like, in science, we follow methods to get truth, and in ethics, we follow principles to act rightly. But does that relate to testing logical consequences?\n\nSo if C is correct, and A and B are not, then the answer would be C. But if D is correct, then all three are right. However, I need to verify which of these are actually part of Hare's argument.\n\nWait, Hare's \"universal prescriptivism\" says that moral statements are like commands, but he also compared ethics to science in a way. He argued that ethical principles can be tested by their logical consequences. So, for example, if a principle leads to contradictions or absurdities, it's rejected. This is similar to how scientific theories are tested. So C seems to be a correct point.\n\nAs for A, science seeks true beliefs, but ethics isn't about true beliefs in the same way. Ethics is about what we ought to do, not what is true. Unless Hare considered that ethical principles are true in a different sense. But I'm not sure. So maybe A is not a correct similarity.\n\nOption B: both are essential for a worthwhile life. While that might be true in general, Hare's focus was more on the structure of ethical statements rather than their role in life. So B might not be his main point.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C.\n",
