  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the question is about comparing ethics and science according to Hare's assertion. The answer choices are A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hare said. Wait, I think Hare is referring to Peter Singer or maybe someone else? Wait, no, the name might be different. Oh, right, there's a philosopher named Hare, like R.M. Hare, who worked on moral philosophy. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about the similarity between ethics and science in their methods or goals.\n\nLet me break down each option. \n\nOption A: Both seek true beliefs about the world. Science definitely aims for true beliefs through empirical evidence and testing. Ethics, though, deals with values and norms rather than factual truths. So maybe A isn't correct because ethics isn't about truth in the same way as science. Unless Hare argues that ethical statements can be true in a different sense, but I'm not sure. This might be a point of contention.\n\nOption B: Both are essential components of a worthwhile life. Well, science contributes to understanding the world, which is part of a good life. Ethics guides how we live, so both could be considered essential. But does that mean they are similar in that aspect? Maybe, but I'm not certain if this is the primary similarity Hare points out.\n\nOption C: Both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences. Science uses hypotheses and tests them through experiments, looking at consequences. Ethics involves applying moral principles and seeing what follows logically, like in deontological or consequentialist theories. For example, utilitarianism tests the consequences of actions. So this seems plausible. If Hare says they both test principles through consequences, then C is a valid point.\n\nNow, the options are (D) all of the above. If all three are correct, then D would be the answer. But I need to check each again.\n\nFor A: Science seeks true beliefs. Ethics, in many philosophical traditions, doesn't aim for truth in the same way. Instead, it's about prescriptive norms. However, some ethical theories, like natural law or certain forms of consequentialism, might claim that ethical statements can have truth value based on outcomes. But I think the traditional view is that science and ethics are different in their goals. So A might not hold.\n\nB: Both being essential components of a worthwhile life. While both contribute, the question is about similarity in what they do, not their importance. So maybe B isn't the main similarity.\n\nC: Testing principles through logical consequences. Science uses hypothesis testing, which involves logical reasoning and consequences. Ethics, especially in consequentialist frameworks, also examines the consequences of actions or principles. So C seems correct.\n\nIf only C is correct, then answer is C. But if D is possible, I need to check if A and B are also correct. However, given that science and ethics differ in their objectives (science for knowledge, ethics for normative guidance), A might not be accurate. Similarly, B is more about their role in life rather than their method. Therefore, the best answer is C.",
