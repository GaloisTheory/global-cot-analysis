The options are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, or adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Leiter International Performance Scale is. From what I remember, it's a type of intelligence test designed to be culturally fair and not rely on verbal skills. It's often used for individuals with developmental disabilities or those who might not perform well on traditional IQ tests because of language barriers or other factors. The key here is that it's a non-verbal test, which makes it suitable for people who might have difficulty with verbal components of IQ tests.\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices. Let's go through each one. \n\nOption A: Adults with visual impairments. If the test is non-verbal, maybe it's not dependent on visual stimuli. But I'm not sure. Maybe some parts of the test require visual tasks. But the Leiter test might be designed to be accessible to people with visual impairments through alternative formats, like tactile materials. However, the question is about which group it's most useful for. \n\nOption B: Children under two. That's very young. Traditional IQ tests for such young children are not really used. The Leiter test might be used for younger children, but I think the test is more for older children and adults. Also, children under two might not have the cognitive development to take such tests effectively. \n\nOption C: Children with hearing impairments. Since the test is non-verbal, it might not require verbal responses. That could make it suitable for children with hearing impairments who might struggle with verbal tests. But the question is about which group it's most useful for. \n\nOption D: Adults who are mentally retarded. Wait, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated. The current term is intellectual disability. But the options use that term. The Leiter test is designed for individuals with intellectual disabilities because it's a non-verbal test. Traditional IQ tests might not be appropriate for those with intellectual disabilities because they might not understand the tasks, but the Leiter test is designed to be more accessible. \n\nSo, the Leiter test is used for people with intellectual disabilities (formerly called mentally retarded), as it's a non-verbal, culturally fair test. Therefore, option D would be the answer. \n\nBut wait, let me check again. The Leiter test is also used for children, but the options here include children under two (B) and children with hearing impairments (C). But the question is about the most useful. Since the Leiter test is used for a range of ages, but for individuals with intellectual disabilities, which would include adults. The answer choices have D as adults who are mentally retarded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the test is used for children with disabilities. But the options are adults with visual impairments (A), children under two (B), children with hearing impairments (C), and adults with mental retardation (D). \n\nI think the key here is that the Leiter test is designed to be used for individuals with intellectual disabilities. Therefore, D would be the answer. Because the other options are either not the primary target (like children under two) or the test's design is to accommodate different impairments, but the primary use is for those with intellectual disabilities. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.\n",
