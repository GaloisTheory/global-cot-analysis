  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The Leiter International Performance Scale is mentioned, and we need to figure out which group it's most useful for measuring intelligence. The answer choices are adults with visual impairments, children under two, children with hearing impairments, or adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst, I should recall what the Leiter scale is. From what I remember, the Leiter International Performance Scale is a type of intelligence test designed to assess cognitive abilities in individuals with developmental disabilities. It's often used when traditional verbal tests aren't suitable, maybe because the person has language barriers or other challenges that affect verbal testing. \n\nWait, but the options here include different groups. Let me break down each choice. \n\nOption A: Adults with visual impairments. If someone can't see well, would the Leiter test be suitable? The Leiter test might be non-verbal, so maybe it's not dependent on visual acuity. But if the test requires reading or looking at symbols, then visual impairment could be an issue. However, the Leiter test is known for being non-verbal and using performance-based tasks, so perhaps it's adapted for people with visual impairments. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nOption B: Children under two. That seems like a very young age. Most standard intelligence tests, like the Bayley Scales, are used for infants and toddlers. The Leiter test is more for older children and adults. So maybe not suitable for children under two. Unless there's a version specifically for that age, but I don't think the Leiter is designed for that.\n\nOption C: Children with hearing impairments. Similar to visual impairments, the Leiter test might be non-verbal, so maybe it's suitable. But if the test has auditory components, then that could be a problem. However, since it's a performance scale, perhaps it's more about motor skills or problem-solving that doesn't require hearing. But again, I'm not certain.\n\nOption D: Adults who are mentally retarded. Wait, the term \"mentally retarded\" is outdated; the correct term is intellectual disability. But assuming the question uses that term, the Leiter test is designed for individuals with intellectual disabilities. It's a non-verbal test, so it's used when verbal tests are not appropriate. So for adults with intellectual disabilities, this test might be more suitable because it doesn't rely on language skills, which might be impaired. \n\nNow, cross-referencing these thoughts. The Leiter test is part of the Leiter-R (Revised) and Leiter-3, which are non-verbal, standardized tests. They are often used for individuals with developmental disabilities or those who can't take verbal tests. So for adults with intellectual disabilities (option D), this test would be useful. \n\nBut wait, what about option A? Adults with visual impairments—could they use the Leiter test? If the test has visual components, then maybe not. But if the test is adapted to be tactile or has alternative formats, then maybe. However, the original question mentions the Leiter International Performance Scale, which is likely designed for non-verbal assessment but may not specifically address visual impairments. \n\nComparing all options, the key point is that the Leiter test is used for individuals with intellectual disabilities, making option D the best fit. Other options either don't align with the test's purpose or are less relevant. Therefore, the answer is D.\n",
