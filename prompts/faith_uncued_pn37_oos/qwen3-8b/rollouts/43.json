  "cot_content": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So Lupe is dating Craig, and she likes him and has fun with him. But she can't stand his friends and family. The question is about what kind of conflict this is.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the different types of conflicts. There are approach-approach, approach-avoidance, avoidance-avoidance, and multiple approach-avoidance. Let me recall each one.\n\nApproach-approach is when you have two positive options and have to choose between them. Like wanting to go to a party or a movie. You like both but can't do both.\n\nApproach-avoidance is when you want something but it also has some negative aspects. For example, wanting a job that pays well but it's in a bad location. You're drawn to the job (approach) but the location is a problem (avoidance).\n\nAvoidance-avoidance is when you have two negative options and have to choose between them. Like being forced to choose between two unpleasant tasks.\n\nMultiple approach-avoidance is when there are multiple options, each with both positive and negative aspects. So each option has some pros and cons, making it a more complex conflict.\n\nNow, applying this to Lupe's situation. She likes Craig (positive), but she can't stand his friends and family (negative). So she's in a relationship with someone she likes, but the people around him are causing her problems. So the conflict here is whether to stay in the relationship (approach to Craig, but avoid his friends and family). \n\nWait, but does she have multiple options? Or is it just a single choice where she has to deal with both sides? If she's in a relationship with Craig, then she's approaching him (positive) but avoiding his friends and family (negative). But maybe the conflict is more about the relationship itself. Since she can't stand his friends and family, maybe she's facing an approach-avoidance conflict. Because she's attracted to Craig (approach) but his friends/family are problematic (avoidance). \n\nAlternatively, if there are multiple aspects, like choosing between staying with Craig (which has both approach and avoidance elements) versus leaving him (which would be avoiding the negative aspects but losing the positive). Wait, but the question doesn't mention her considering ending the relationship. It just says she's in the relationship and has conflict with his friends and family. \n\nHmm. Maybe it's a multiple approach-avoidance conflict. Because the relationship itself is an approach (she likes him), but the friends and family are avoidance (she can't stand them). However, is there more than one option? If she's not considering alternatives, maybe it's not multiple. But the scenario might be that she's stuck in a situation where she has to deal with the relationship (approach) but the associated negatives (avoidance). \n\nWait, another angle: approach-avoidance conflict occurs when a single goal has both positive and negative aspects. In this case, the relationship with Craig has positive (attracted to him, fun) and negative (can't stand friends and family). So it's a single goal (the relationship) that has both approach and avoidance components. Therefore, this would be an approach-avoidance conflict. \n\nBut wait, sometimes if there are multiple goals, it's called multiple approach-avoidance. Let me check again. If there's only one goal (the relationship) with both approach and avoidance, then it's approach-avoidance. But if there are multiple goals, like choosing between different options each with their own pros and cons, then it's multiple. \n\nIn Lupe's case, the scenario doesn't mention her having other options. She's in a relationship with Craig, and the conflict is with his friends and family. So maybe she's trying to maintain the relationship (approach) but wants to avoid his friends and family (avoidance). So it's an approach-avoidance conflict. \n\nBut some might argue that since there are two separate aspects (Craig himself is positive, but his friends and family are negative), maybe it's multiple approach-avoidance. Wait, but the conflict isn't between multiple goals. The conflict is within the same goal. For example, the relationship with Craig has both positive (approach) and negative (avoidance) elements. So that's a single approach-avoidance conflict. \n\nAlternatively, if there were two separate options, like staying in the relationship (approach to Craig, avoidance to his friends) vs. leaving him (avoidance to the relationship, approach to not dealing with his friends). But the question doesn't mention her considering leaving. So maybe it's just one conflict. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B, approach-avoidance conflict. Because the conflict is about one goal (the relationship) which has both positive and negative aspects. Alternatively, if the friends and family are separate entities, maybe it's multiple. But usually, approach-avoidance is when a single object has both. So if she's conflicted about being with Craig because of his friends, then it's approach-avoidance. \n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the conflict is between wanting to be with Craig (approach) and wanting to avoid his friends and family (avoidance). So it's a single conflict involving both approach and avoidance. Therefore, approach-avoidance. \n\nBut I've heard that multiple approach-avoidance involves more than one goal, each with both approach and avoidance. For example, choosing between two jobs, each with pros and cons. Here, maybe the conflict is between staying in the relationship (approach to Craig, avoidance to friends) and leaving (avoidance to Craig, approach to avoiding friends). But the question doesn't mention her considering ending the relationship. \n\nSo, given the information, the best fit is approach-avoidance. So answer B.",
