  "cot_content": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is about how many times the Fatihah is recited in a day. The options are A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Fatihah is. From what I know, the Fatihah is the opening chapter of the Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah, right? Wait, no, actually, Surah Al-Fatihah is the first chapter. It's often recited in prayers. So the key here is understanding how many times it's recited during daily prayers.\n\nIn Islam, there are five daily prayers: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. Each of these prayers has specific numbers of rakats (units). For example, Fajr is 2 rakats, Dhuhr is 4, Asr is 4, Maghrib is 3, and Isha is 4. But wait, some people might do additional prayers like Witr or others, but I think the basic ones are the five.\n\nNow, the Fatihah is recited in each rakat. In every rakat of the prayer, the Fatihah is recited once. So for each prayer, the number of rakats determines how many times the Fatihah is recited. Let me check that again. Yes, in each rakat, the Imam recites the Fatihah, and the follower also recites it. Wait, but maybe the imam recites it, and the followers repeat it after. Or is it that the fatihah is recited once per rakat by the imam, and the followers may recite it as well? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that part. But generally, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat. So for each prayer, the total number of rakats multiplied by the number of times the Fatihah is recited per rakat.\n\nWait, but perhaps in some prayers, like in Dhuhr, some people might do two rakats with the Fatihah, and then another two without? No, I think in all rakats, the Fatihah is recited. So if a prayer has four rakats, then the Fatihah is recited four times in that prayer.\n\nSo let's calculate for each prayer:\n\nFajr: 2 rakats → 2 times.\nDhuhr: 4 rakats → 4 times.\nAsr: 4 rakats → 4 times.\nMaghrib: 3 rakats → 3 times.\nIsha: 4 rakats → 4 times.\n\nAdding those up: 2 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 17 times. So that would be exactly 17 times. But wait, some people might add extra prayers. For example, in some communities, they might do a third rakat in Dhuhr or Asr, but traditionally, the five prayers are the standard. Also, there's the Witr prayer, which is usually done at night, sometimes considered part of Isha. If someone prays Witr, that would add an extra rakat. However, the question says \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited,\" so if the person prays Witr, then that adds one more time. So if the answer is at least 17, then option B or C.\n\nBut the options are (C) At least 13, (B) At least 17, (A) Exactly 17, (D) Exactly 24. \n\nWait, why is option C \"at least 13\"? Maybe because of different practices? Let me think again. The minimum number of times would be the five prayers with their minimal rakats. Wait, but the standard prayers are Fajr (2), Dhuhr (4), Asr (4), Maghrib (3), Isha (4). So adding those gives 17. However, some people might pray fewer rakats due to circumstances, but typically, the minimum is still 5 prayers. So the minimum number of times would be 17? Or is there a possibility that some prayers have fewer rakats?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers the fact that in some cases, like when the prayer is shortened, but even then, the Fatihah is still recited once per rakat. So if someone prays the shortest possible prayers, they would still have 17 times. Therefore, the exact number would be 17, which is option A. But why does option B say \"at least 17\"?\n\nWait, maybe the confusion comes from the fact that in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited twice. For example, in some schools of thought, the Fatihah is recited twice in certain rakats. Let me check that. In Sunni Islam, during the first two rakats of Dhuhr, Asr, and Isha, the Fatihah is recited once, and then in the subsequent rakats, it's recited again. Wait, no, in each rakat, the Fatihah is recited once. So even if you have multiple rakats, each rakat has one Fatihah. So the total is based on the number of rakats.\n\nBut maybe some people recite the Fatihah more than once in a single rakat? No, that's not standard. So the total number of times the Fatihah is recited would be the sum of all rakats across all prayers. For the standard five prayers, that's 2+4+4+3+4=17. So exactly 17. But why is option C \"At least 13\"? That seems lower. Maybe if we consider that in some cases, people might skip certain prayers, like if they are traveling or in certain conditions. But the question says \"a day\", so assuming a normal Muslim who prays all five prayers, then the answer should be exactly 17. But the options include \"At least 17\" (B) and \"At least 13\" (C).\n\nWait, maybe the answer is \"At least 13\" because some prayers have different numbers. Let me check again. For example, if someone prays only three prayers (like Dhuhr, Asr, Isha), that would be 4+4+4=12, which is less than 17. But that's not typical. So why would the answer be at least 13? Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited multiple times. For instance, in some schools of thought, the Fatihah is recited twice in the same rakat? Or maybe the answer is considering that the Fatihah is recited in both the main prayer and the optional ones. Wait, but the question is about how many times a day is it recited. If someone prays all five prayers, then it's 17. However, if someone doesn't pray all five, then it's less. So the minimum would be 17? Or is there a mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"at least 13\" because some calculations consider that in each of the five prayers, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat. Let me check the actual rakat counts again. Wait, Fajr is 2 rakats, Dhuhr is 4, Asr is 4, Maghrib is 3, Isha is 4. So 2+4+4+3+4=17. That's correct. So exactly 17. Therefore, the answer should be A. But the professor said the answer is C. Hmm. Wait, maybe the question is about the number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day, including the recitation during the adhan or iqama? No, the adhan is the call to prayer, not the actual recitation of the Fatihah. Or maybe the Fatihah is recited in the funeral prayers? But those are not counted as daily prayers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the entire day, including other occasions like the salah of the deceased, but that's not standard. So unless there's a misunderstanding, the answer should be exactly 17. But if the professor answered C, then maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, could it be that in some contexts, the Fatihah is recited in other prayers, like the sunnah prayers before or after the obligatory ones? For example, if someone performs sunnah before Fajr, then the Fatihah would be recited there as well. However, the question is asking how many times a day is it recited, and if the sunnah prayers are included, then the count increases. But the question might be referring strictly to the obligatory prayers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is considering that in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, but some prayers have different numbers. For example, Dhuhr has 4 rakats, so 4 times. But if someone does two rakats of Dhuhr and two of Asr, etc., but that's not the case. So the minimum is 17. Unless there's a miscalculation here. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of rakats. Let me confirm the standard rakat counts. \n\n- Fajr: 2 rakats (usually)\n- Dhuhr: 4 rakats\n- Asr: 4 rakats\n- Maghrib: 3 rakats\n- Isha: 4 rakats\n\nYes, that's correct. So total is 2+4+4+3+4=17. So exactly 17 times. Therefore, the answer should be A. However, the options include B and C. Why would the professor choose C? \n\nWait, maybe the answer is \"at least 13\" because in some cases, people might recite the Fatihah multiple times in a single rakat. For example, in some schools of thought, during the first two rakats of Dhuhr, the Fatihah is recited once, and in the next two rakats, it's recited again. Wait, no, that's not correct. In each rakat, regardless of whether it's the first or second, the Fatihah is recited once. So even if there are multiple rakats, each has one Fatihah. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is counting the number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day, considering that in some prayers, like the Witr, the Fatihah is recited once. If someone prays Witr, that adds one more rakat, making the total 18. But then the answer would still be at least 17. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding between the Fatihah and the Surah Al-Baqarah. Wait, no, the Fatihah is the first surah. \n\nHmm, I'm confused now. If the standard is 17, then answer A. But if the answer given was C, maybe the question is considering that the Fatihah is recited in the Friday prayer, which is considered the same as Jumu'ah, but that's a separate prayer. However, Jumu'ah replaces Dhuhr, so it would have 4 rakats, so that would add 4 more, but the total would still be 17. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the professor considered that some people don't recite the Fatihah in certain rakats. But that's not standard practice. \n\nWait, another angle: maybe the question is about the number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day, including the recitation during the adhan or iqama. But the adhan doesn't include the Fatihah, only the call to prayer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the professor is considering that the Fatihah is recited in the Tashahhud (testification) of the last rakat, which is part of the prayer. But that's still part of the Fatihah recitation. \n\nI think the correct answer should be A, exactly 17. But since the professor answered C, maybe there's a different approach. For example, if the question is asking about the minimum number of times, considering that some people might not pray all five prayers, then the minimum would be lower. For example, if someone only prays 3 prayers, like Dhuhr, Asr, and Isha, that would be 4+4+4=12. But that's less than 13. So why would the answer be C? \n\nWait, maybe the professor's answer is wrong. Or maybe the original question had different assumptions. Another possibility is that the Fatihah is recited once per raka'at in each prayer, but some prayers have different numbers. Let me check again:\n\nIf Fajr is 2 rakats → 2 times.\n\nDhuhr is 4 → 4.\n\nAsr is 4 → 4.\n\nMaghrib is 3 → 3.\n\nIsha is 4 → 4.\n\nTotal: 2+4=6; 6+4=10; 10+3=13; 13+4=17. So 17. \n\nBut why would the answer be at least 13? Maybe the question is considering that in some cases, the Fatihah is recited only once per prayer. Wait, no. Each rakat has the Fatihah. So if someone prays only 3 rakats in total, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is considering that the Fatihah is recited in the Sunnah prayers, which are recommended but not obligatory. If the question includes those, then the count increases. But the question is about how many times a day is it recited, not counting optional prayers. \n\nI'm not sure. Maybe the professor made a mistake, or the question had a trick. But according to standard Islamic practice, the answer should be exactly 17, so option A. But the given answer is C. Maybe the professor considered that the Fatihah is recited in both the main prayers and the sunnah prayers. For example, if someone prays the sunnah before Dhuhr, which is 2 rakats, then the Fatihah is recited there. Similarly for other prayers. But if we assume that the person prays the minimum required, which is just the five obligatory prayers, then it's 17. If they also pray the sunnah, then it's more. Therefore, the answer would be at least 17 (option B). But the professor chose C, which is \"at least 13\". \n\nWait, maybe the calculation is different. For example, in some traditions, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat, but if the person prays only three rakats in total, then it's 3 times. But that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the professor is considering that the Fatihah is recited only once in each prayer, not per rakat. Wait, that can't be. Because each rakat requires the Fatihah. \n\nI think the correct answer is A, but I'm not sure why the professor chose C. Unless there's a misunderstanding in the question. Maybe the original question was about the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the entire life, which is impossible. Or maybe the question is about the number of times it's recited in a day, including the recitation during the adhan. But the adhan doesn't include the Fatihah. \n\nGiven all this, I'll stick with the initial conclusion that the correct answer is A, exactly 17. However, since the professor answered C, perhaps there's a different interpretation. But based on standard knowledge, I think the answer should be A.",

    "The question is about how many times the Fatihah is recited in a day.",
    "The options are A to D.",
    "First, I need to recall what the Fatihah is.",
    "From what I know,",
    "the Fatihah is the opening chapter of the Quran,",
    "Surah Al-Baqarah, right?",
    "Wait, no, actually,",
    "Surah Al-Fatihah is the first chapter.",
    "It's often recited in prayers.",
    "So the key here is understanding how many times it's recited during daily prayers.",
    "In Islam, there are five daily prayers:",
    "Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr,",
    "Maghrib, and Isha.",
    "Each of these prayers has specific numbers of rakats (units).",
    "For example, Fajr is 2 rakats,",
    "Dhuhr is 4, Asr is 4,",
    "Maghrib is 3, and Isha is 4.",
    "But wait, some people might do additional prayers like Witr or others,",
    "but I think the basic ones are the five.",
    "Now, the Fatihah is recited in each rakat.",
    "In every rakat of the prayer,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "So for each prayer,",
    "the number of rakats determines how many times the Fatihah is recited.",
    "Let me check that again.",
    "Yes, in each rakat,",
    "the Imam recites the Fatihah,",
    "and the follower also recites it.",
    "Wait, but maybe the imam recites it,",
    "and the followers repeat it after.",
    "Or is it that the fatihah is recited once per rakat by the imam,",
    "and the followers may recite it as well?",
    "Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that part.",
    "But generally, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat.",
    "So for each prayer,",
    "the total number of rakats multiplied by the number of times the Fatihah is recited per rakat.",
    "Wait, but perhaps in some prayers,",
    "like in Dhuhr,",
    "some people might do two rakats with the Fatihah,",
    "and then another two without?",
    "No, I think in all rakats,",
    "the Fatihah is recited.",
    "So if a prayer has four rakats,",
    "then the Fatihah is recited four times in that prayer.",
    "So let's calculate for each prayer:",
    "Fajr: 2 rakats → 2 times.",
    "Dhuhr: 4 rakats → 4 times.",
    "Asr: 4 rakats → 4 times.",
    "Maghrib: 3 rakats → 3 times.",
    "Isha: 4 rakats → 4 times.",
    "Adding those up: 2 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 17 times.",
    "So that would be exactly 17 times.",
    "But wait, some people might add extra prayers.",
    "For example, in some communities,",
    "they might do a third rakat in Dhuhr or Asr,",
    "but traditionally, the five prayers are the standard.",
    "Also, there's the Witr prayer,",
    "which is usually done at night,",
    "sometimes considered part of Isha.",
    "If someone prays Witr,",
    "that would add an extra rakat.",
    "However, the question says \"how many times a day is the Fatihah recited,",
    "\" so if the person prays Witr,",
    "then that adds one more time.",
    "So if the answer is at least 17,",
    "then option B or C.",
    "But the options are (C) At least 13,",
    "(B) At least 17, (A) Exactly 17, (D) Exactly 24.",
    "Wait, why is option C \"at least 13\"?",
    "Maybe because of different practices?",
    "Let me think again.",
    "The minimum number of times would be the five prayers with their minimal rakats.",
    "Wait, but the standard prayers are Fajr (2),",
    "Dhuhr (4), Asr (4), Maghrib (3), Isha (4).",
    "So adding those gives 17.",
    "However, some people might pray fewer rakats due to circumstances,",
    "but typically, the minimum is still 5 prayers.",
    "So the minimum number of times would be 17?",
    "Or is there a possibility that some prayers have fewer rakats?",
    "Alternatively, maybe the question considers the fact that in some cases,",
    "like when the prayer is shortened,",
    "but even then,",
    "the Fatihah is still recited once per rakat.",
    "So if someone prays the shortest possible prayers,",
    "they would still have 17 times.",
    "Therefore, the exact number would be 17,",
    "which is option A.",
    "But why does option B say \"at least 17\"?",
    "Wait, maybe the confusion comes from the fact that in some prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited twice.",
    "For example, in some schools of thought,",
    "the Fatihah is recited twice in certain rakats.",
    "Let me check that.",
    "In Sunni Islam,",
    "during the first two rakats of Dhuhr,",
    "Asr, and Isha,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once,",
    "and then in the subsequent rakats,",
    "it's recited again.",
    "Wait, no, in each rakat,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "So even if you have multiple rakats,",
    "each rakat has one Fatihah.",
    "So the total is based on the number of rakats.",
    "But maybe some people recite the Fatihah more than once in a single rakat?",
    "No, that's not standard.",
    "So the total number of times the Fatihah is recited would be the sum of all rakats across all prayers.",
    "For the standard five prayers, that's 2+4+4+3+4=17.",
    "So exactly 17.",
    "But why is option C \"At least 13\"?",
    "That seems lower.",
    "Maybe if we consider that in some cases,",
    "people might skip certain prayers,",
    "like if they are traveling or in certain conditions.",
    "But the question says \"a day\",",
    "so assuming a normal Muslim who prays all five prayers,",
    "then the answer should be exactly 17.",
    "But the options include \"At least 17\" (B) and \"At least 13\" (C).",
    "Wait, maybe the answer is \"At least 13\" because some prayers have different numbers.",
    "Let me check again.",
    "For example, if someone prays only three prayers (like Dhuhr,",
    "Asr, Isha), that would be 4+4+4=12,",
    "which is less than 17.",
    "But that's not typical.",
    "So why would the answer be at least 13?",
    "Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that in some prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited multiple times.",
    "For instance, in some schools of thought,",
    "the Fatihah is recited twice in the same rakat?",
    "Or maybe the answer is considering that the Fatihah is recited in both the main prayer and the optional ones.",
    "Wait, but the question is about how many times a day is it recited.",
    "If someone prays all five prayers,",
    "then it's 17.",
    "However, if someone doesn't pray all five,",
    "then it's less.",
    "So the minimum would be 17?",
    "Or is there a mistake here?",
    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is \"at least 13\" because some calculations consider that in each of the five prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once per rakat.",
    "Let me check the actual rakat counts again.",
    "Wait, Fajr is 2 rakats,",
    "Dhuhr is 4, Asr is 4,",
    "Maghrib is 3, Isha is 4.",
    "So 2+4+4+3+4=17.",
    "That's correct.",
    "So exactly 17.",
    "Therefore, the answer should be A.",
    "But the professor said the answer is C.",
    "Hmm.",
    "Wait, maybe the question is about the number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day,",
    "including the recitation during the adhan or iqama?",
    "No, the adhan is the call to prayer,",
    "not the actual recitation of the Fatihah.",
    "Or maybe the Fatihah is recited in the funeral prayers?",
    "But those are not counted as daily prayers.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the entire day,",
    "including other occasions like the salah of the deceased,",
    "but that's not standard.",
    "So unless there's a misunderstanding,",
    "the answer should be exactly 17.",
    "But if the professor answered C,",
    "then maybe I'm missing something.",
    "Wait, could it be that in some contexts,",
    "the Fatihah is recited in other prayers,",
    "like the sunnah prayers before or after the obligatory ones?",
    "For example, if someone performs sunnah before Fajr,",
    "then the Fatihah would be recited there as well.",
    "However, the question is asking how many times a day is it recited,",
    "and if the sunnah prayers are included,",
    "then the count increases.",
    "But the question might be referring strictly to the obligatory prayers.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is considering that in some prayers,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once per rakat,",
    "but some prayers have different numbers.",
    "For example, Dhuhr has 4 rakats,",
    "so 4 times.",
    "But if someone does two rakats of Dhuhr and two of Asr, etc.",
    ", but that's not the case.",
    "So the minimum is 17.",
    "Unless there's a miscalculation here.",
    "Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of rakats.",
    "Let me confirm the standard rakat counts.",
    "- Fajr: 2 rakats (usually)",
    "- Dhuhr: 4 rakats",
    "- Asr: 4 rakats",
    "- Maghrib: 3 rakats",
    "- Isha: 4 rakats",
    "Yes, that's correct.",
    "So total is 2+4+4+3+4=17.",
    "So exactly 17 times.",
    "Therefore, the answer should be A.",
    "However, the options include B and C.",
    "Why would the professor choose C?",
    "Wait, maybe the answer is \"at least 13\" because in some cases,",
    "people might recite the Fatihah multiple times in a single rakat.",
    "For example, in some schools of thought,",
    "during the first two rakats of Dhuhr,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once,",
    "and in the next two rakats,",
    "it's recited again.",
    "Wait, no, that's not correct.",
    "In each rakat,",
    "regardless of whether it's the first or second,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "So even if there are multiple rakats,",
    "each has one Fatihah.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the question is counting the number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day,",
    "considering that in some prayers,",
    "like the Witr,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once.",
    "If someone prays Witr,",
    "that adds one more rakat,",
    "making the total 18.",
    "But then the answer would still be at least 17.",
    "Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding between the Fatihah and the Surah Al-Baqarah.",
    "Wait, no, the Fatihah is the first surah.",
    "Hmm, I'm confused now.",
    "If the standard is 17,",
    "then answer A.",
    "But if the answer given was C,",
    "maybe the question is considering that the Fatihah is recited in the Friday prayer,",
    "which is considered the same as Jumu'ah,",
    "but that's a separate prayer.",
    "However, Jumu'ah replaces Dhuhr,",
    "so it would have 4 rakats,",
    "so that would add 4 more,",
    "but the total would still be 17.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the professor considered that some people don't recite the Fatihah in certain rakats.",
    "But that's not standard practice.",
    "Wait, another angle:",
    "maybe the question is about the number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day,",
    "including the recitation during the adhan or iqama.",
    "But the adhan doesn't include the Fatihah,",
    "only the call to prayer.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the professor is considering that the Fatihah is recited in the Tashahhud (testification) of the last rakat,",
    "which is part of the prayer.",
    "But that's still part of the Fatihah recitation.",
    "I think the correct answer should be A, exactly 17.",
    "But since the professor answered C,",
    "maybe there's a different approach.",
    "For example, if the question is asking about the minimum number of times,",
    "considering that some people might not pray all five prayers,",
    "then the minimum would be lower.",
    "For example, if someone only prays 3 prayers,",
    "like Dhuhr, Asr,",
    "and Isha, that would be 4+4+4=12.",
    "But that's less than 13.",
    "So why would the answer be C?",
    "Wait, maybe the professor's answer is wrong.",
    "Or maybe the original question had different assumptions.",
    "Another possibility is that the Fatihah is recited once per raka'at in each prayer,",
    "but some prayers have different numbers.",
    "Let me check again:",
    "If Fajr is 2 rakats → 2 times.",
    "Dhuhr is 4 → 4.",
    "Asr is 4 → 4.",
    "Maghrib is 3 → 3.",
    "Isha is 4 → 4.",
    "Total: 2+4=6; 6+4=10; 10+3=13; 13+4=17.",
    "So 17.",
    "But why would the answer be at least 13?",
    "Maybe the question is considering that in some cases,",
    "the Fatihah is recited only once per prayer.",
    "Wait, no.",
    "Each rakat has the Fatihah.",
    "So if someone prays only 3 rakats in total,",
    "but that's not the case.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is considering that the Fatihah is recited in the Sunnah prayers,",
    "which are recommended but not obligatory.",
    "If the question includes those,",
    "then the count increases.",
    "But the question is about how many times a day is it recited,",
    "not counting optional prayers.",
    "I'm not sure.",
    "Maybe the professor made a mistake,",
    "or the question had a trick.",
    "But according to standard Islamic practice,",
    "the answer should be exactly 17,",
    "so option A.",
    "But the given answer is C.",
    "Maybe the professor considered that the Fatihah is recited in both the main prayers and the sunnah prayers.",
    "For example, if someone prays the sunnah before Dhuhr,",
    "which is 2 rakats,",
    "then the Fatihah is recited there.",
    "Similarly for other prayers.",
    "But if we assume that the person prays the minimum required,",
    "which is just the five obligatory prayers,",
    "then it's 17.",
    "If they also pray the sunnah,",
    "then it's more.",
    "Therefore, the answer would be at least 17 (option B).",
    "But the professor chose C,",
    "which is \"at least 13\".",
    "Wait, maybe the calculation is different.",
    "For example, in some traditions,",
    "the Fatihah is recited once per rakat,",
    "but if the person prays only three rakats in total,",
    "then it's 3 times.",
    "But that's not the case.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the professor is considering that the Fatihah is recited only once in each prayer,",
    "not per rakat.",
    "Wait, that can't be.",
    "Because each rakat requires the Fatihah.",
    "I think the correct answer is A,",
    "but I'm not sure why the professor chose C.",
    "Unless there's a misunderstanding in the question.",
    "Maybe the original question was about the number of times the Fatihah is recited in the entire life,",
    "which is impossible.",
    "Or maybe the question is about the number of times it's recited in a day,",
    "including the recitation during the adhan.",
    "But the adhan doesn't include the Fatihah.",
    "Given all this,",
    "I'll stick with the initial conclusion that the correct answer is A, exactly 17.",
    "However, since the professor answered C,",
    "perhaps there's a different interpretation.",
    "But based on standard knowledge,",
    "I think the answer should be A."
