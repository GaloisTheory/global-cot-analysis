  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how many times the Fatihah is recited in a day. First, I need to remember what the Fatihah is. It's the first chapter of the Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah, right? Wait, no, actually, Surah Al-Fatihah is the first chapter. Yes, that's correct. So, the Fatihah is Surah Al-Fatihah.\n\nNow, the question is about how many times it's recited in a day. Let me think. In Islamic prayer (salah), the Fatihah is recited in each of the obligatory prayers. There are five daily prayers: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. So, each of these prayers requires reciting the Fatihah once. That would be five times a day, right? But wait, maybe there are more prayers or additional recitations?\n\nWait, there's also the Witr prayer, which some Muslims perform, especially at night. But I think Witr is considered a voluntary prayer and not obligatory for everyone. So, if someone prays Witr, they might recite the Fatihah again. But the question is about how many times a day it's recited. The answer might depend on whether Witr is included or not. Also, some people might recite the Fatihah in other situations, like during voluntary prayers or in some rituals.\n\nBut the question might be referring to the obligatory prayers. Let's check that. For the five daily prayers, each requires the recitation of the Fatihah once. So that's five times. However, sometimes in longer prayers, like Dhuhr and Asr, there are additional surahs recited after the Fatihah. But the Fatihah itself is recited once per prayer. So, five times a day.\n\nWait, but wait. What about the Sunnah prayers? For example, some people pray two rakats of sunnah before Fajr and after Fajr, and similarly for other prayers. In those sunnah prayers, the Fatihah is also recited. So, if someone prays the sunnah, then the number increases. But the question is about how many times it's recited. If the question is about the minimum, then maybe it's five times. But the answer options don't include 5. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe answer choices are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24.\n\nHmm. So, maybe there's more to it. Let me think again. The Fatihah is recited in each of the five daily prayers. But in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once per rakat. Wait, no. In each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat. For example, in Fajr, the first rakat has the Fatihah, then the second rakat also has the Fatihah. Wait, no. In each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat. For example, in Fajr, there are two rakats. The first rakat has the Fatihah, and the second rakat also has the Fatihah? Or is it only once per prayer?\n\nWait, I need to clarify. In each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat. For example, in Fajr, which has two rakats, the first rakat includes the Fatihah, and the second rakat does not. Wait, no. Wait, in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once. For example, in each of the five daily prayers, the Fatihah is recited once. So, that's five times. But that's only if each prayer has one rakat. But some prayers have more rakats. Wait, but regardless of the number of rakats, the Fatihah is recited once in each prayer. So, five times a day.\n\nBut that doesn't match the answer choices. So, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited multiple times. For example, in some prayers, especially longer ones, there are additional recitations. But the Fatihah is not recited multiple times in the same prayer. The Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat of each prayer. So, each prayer has one Fatihah. Therefore, five times a day.\n\nBut the answer choices don't have 5. So, maybe the question is considering the recitation in other contexts. For example, during the recitation of the Quran, or in some other prayers. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah during the daily prayers plus other times. For example, during the Witr prayer, which is sometimes considered part of the night prayer. But even then, that's an additional time. So, if someone prays Witr, that's an extra Fatihah. But again, that depends on the individual.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the five daily prayers, and in some cases, the Fatihah is recited more than once. For example, in some schools of thought, the Fatihah is recited in each rakat. Wait, no. In each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat. So, five times. However, if someone prays the sunnah prayers, then in those prayers, the Fatihah is recited. For example, in the sunnah before Fajr, which is two rakats, the Fatihah is recited once. So, if someone prays the sunnah, that adds more Fatihahs.\n\nBut the question might be asking for the minimum number of times, which would be when someone only prays the obligatory prayers. So, five times. But again, the answer choices don't have 5. So, I must be missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the total number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers, considering that each prayer has multiple rakats. Wait, but each prayer, regardless of the number of rakats, has the Fatihah recited once. So, for example, in Fajr, which has two rakats, the Fatihah is recited once. In Dhuhr, which has four rakats, the Fatihah is recited once. So, total five times. So, that's five. But again, the answer options don't have that.\n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation during the recitation of the Quran. But that's not specified. Or maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the five daily prayers, but in some cases, the Fatihah is recited more than once in a prayer. Let me check.\n\nIn some prayers, like in the longer ones, the Fatihah is recited once. For example, in Dhuhr, Asr, and Isha, there are multiple rakats, but the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat. So, each prayer has one Fatihah. So, five times a day. However, in some circumstances, like in the Witr prayer, which is an additional prayer, the Fatihah is recited once. So, that's six times. But again, the answer options don't have 5 or 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 17. How does that come? Let me think. Maybe the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five daily prayers, but each prayer has multiple rakats where the Fatihah is recited. Wait, no. For example, in Fajr, there are two rakats, but the Fatihah is recited once. So, five times. Unless the Fatihah is recited more than once in a prayer. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation in the Tarawih prayers during Ramadan. Tarawih is a special prayer performed during Ramadan, which can have 20 rakats. In each rakat of Tarawih, the Fatihah is recited. So, if someone prays Tarawih, that's 20 times. But Tarawih is not obligatory, so that's not counted in the daily recitations. So, the answer would depend on whether the question is considering Tarawih.\n\nBut the question says \"a day\", which could include Ramadan, but the options don't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation in the Witr prayer. For example, if someone prays Witr, then that's an additional Fatihah. So, five plus one is six. Still not matching the answer choices.\n\nWait, maybe the question is considering the recitation of the Fatihah in the five daily prayers, plus the recitation in the sunnah prayers. For example, in the sunnah before Fajr, there are two rakats, each with the Fatihah. Similarly, in the sunnah after Fajr, two rakats. So, that's four rakats, each with the Fatihah. So, that's four more. Adding to the five obligatory prayers, that's nine. But again, not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus some other prayers. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again. The answer choices are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24.\n\nWait, maybe the question is referring to the total number of times the Fatihah is recited in the daily prayers, considering that in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited more than once. Wait, but no, each prayer has only one Fatihah.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 17 because of the following: five daily prayers, each with one Fatihah, plus the Witr prayer (one Fatihah), plus some other prayers. But that would be seven. Still not 17.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers, but with multiple recitations in each prayer. For example, in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited once, but in others, it's recited multiple times. Wait, no, the Fatihah is recited once in each prayer.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is (B) At least 17. Let me think. If someone prays the five daily prayers, each with one Fatihah, that's five. Then, if they also pray the sunnah prayers, which have more rakats. For example, in the sunnah before Fajr, two rakats, each with Fatihah. Similarly, after Fajr, two rakats. So, that's four more. Then the sunnah before Dhuhr, two rakats, and after Dhuhr, two rakats. Similarly for Asr and Isha. So that's 2+2+2+2+2=10. Wait, that's 10 sunnah rakats. So, total of five obligatory and ten sunnah, making fifteen. Plus Witr, which is one. That's 16. Plus maybe some other prayers. Hmm, that's getting to 17. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (B) At least 17, because the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited is five (obligatory), but if you include other prayers like sunnah, it can be more. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers, but considering that each prayer has multiple rakats where the Fatihah is recited. Wait, no. In each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat. So, five times.\n\nI'm confused because the answer choices don't include 5. So, maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation in the Tarawih prayers. But that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (B) At least 17, considering that in some cases, the Fatihah is recited more than once in a day. But I can't think of how that would reach 17.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, and there are multiple prayers. Wait, if I think of each prayer as having 2 rakats, then the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, so five times. But that's still five.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13. Because if someone prays the five daily prayers (5), plus the sunnah prayers (which could be 8 rakats, each with Fatihah), that's 5+8=13. But again, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing that the Fatihah is recited in each of the daily prayers multiple times. For example, in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited in each rakat. Wait, no. In each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat. So, regardless of the number of rakats, the Fatihah is once per prayer.\n\nI think I need to look up the standard number of recitations of the Fatihah. Wait, but since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on my knowledge. In the five daily prayers, the Fatihah is recited once each. That's five. If someone also prays the Witr prayer, that's one more. So, six. If they also pray the sunnah, that adds more. For example, in the sunnah before Fajr, two rakats with Fatihah. Similarly, after Fajr, two. So, that's four more. Similarly for other prayers. So, total of 5 (obligatory) + 4 (sunnah) + 1 (Witr) = 10. But this is getting to 10, not 17.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation in the funeral prayer. But that's not a daily occurrence.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me think again. The answer options are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is (B) At least 17. Because the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day is 17. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that in each of the daily prayers, the Fatihah is recited once, and each prayer has multiple rakats. For example, Fajr has 2 rakats, Dhuhr has 4, Asr has 4, Maghrib has 3, and Isha has 4. So, total rakats in daily prayers is 2+4+4+3+4=17. But the Fatihah is recited once in each prayer, not once per rakat. So, that would still be 5 times. So, this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation in the Witr prayer. If someone prays Witr, that's an additional Fatihah. So, 5+1=6. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13. Because if someone prays all the sunnah prayers and the obligatory ones. Let's say 5 obligatory, plus 8 sunnah (like 2 before and after each of the five prayers), that would be 5+8=13. So, at least 13. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nI think the key here is that the question might be referring to the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day, which is five (obligatory prayers). But since that's not an option, maybe the answer expects considering some other practices. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation in the Witr prayer and other sunnah prayers, leading to a minimum of 13 or 17.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is (B) At least 17. But I'm not sure. Given that the answer choices don't include 5, perhaps the correct answer is (B) At least 17, considering that in some Islamic traditions, there are more recitations. But I'm not certain. However, based on the options given, and the fact that the Fatihah is recited in each of the five daily prayers, and possibly in other prayers like Witr or sunnah, the minimum would be 5, but since 5 is not an option, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13. \n\nWait, another angle: each time you pray, you recite the Fatihah once. The five daily prayers are five times. But in some prayers, like Isha, there are additional rakats. Wait, no, the Fatihah is still recited once per prayer. So, five times. But the options don't have that. Maybe the question is about the recitation during the entire day, including the night prayer. For example, if someone prays Witr, that's one more. So, 6. But again, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Exactly 24. That seems high. 24 times? Maybe if someone prays all the prayers multiple times. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nI think I'm missing something here. Let me recall that in some Islamic schools of thought, the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five daily prayers, and in some cases, it's recited multiple times. But I can't recall a number like 17. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation in the Tarawih prayers. For example, during Ramadan, Tarawih is 20 rakats, each with the Fatihah. So, 20. Adding to the five daily prayers, that's 25. But again, the question says \"a day\", not specifically Ramadan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (B) At least 17, considering that the minimum is 17. But without knowing the exact calculation, I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look at the options again. The answer choices are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24. \n\nIf the Fatihah is recited in the five daily prayers, that's 5 times. If someone also prays the Witr prayer, that's 6. If they also pray the sunnah prayers, which can add more. For example, if each of the five prayers has 2 sunnah rakats before and after, that's 2*5*2=20. Adding to the obligatory 5, that's 25. But this seems too high. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is (C) At least 13. If the minimum number is 5, but the options don't have that, maybe the correct answer is (C) At least 13, considering that in some cases, the Fatihah is recited more than once in a day. But I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that I can't find a clear answer, but the options are given, I think the most plausible is (B) At least 17, assuming that the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited is 17. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is (B) At least 17 because in some contexts, the Fatihah is recited multiple times. For example, in the five daily prayers, each with one Fatihah, that's 5. Then, if you include the Witr prayer, that's 6. And if you include the sunnah prayers, which can add more. For example, if someone prays 2 sunnah before and after each of the five prayers, that's 2*5=10. Adding to the 6, that's 16. Plus maybe some other prayers, making it 17. So, \"at least 17\" would be the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (B).\n",

    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is (B) At least 17, because the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited is five (obligatory), but if you include other prayers like sunnah, it can be more.",
    "But I'm not sure if that's accurate.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers, but considering that each prayer has multiple rakats where the Fatihah is recited.",
    "Wait, no.",
    "In each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat.",
    "So, five times.",
    "I'm confused because the answer choices don't include 5.",
    "So, maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation in the Tarawih prayers.",
    "But that's not clear.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is (B) At least 17, considering that in some cases, the Fatihah is recited more than once in a day.",
    "But I can't think of how that would reach 17.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that in each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once, and there are multiple prayers.",
    "Wait, if I think of each prayer as having 2 rakats, then the Fatihah is recited once per prayer, so five times.",
    "But that's still five.",
    "Wait, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13.",
    "Because if someone prays the five daily prayers (5), plus the sunnah prayers (which could be 8 rakats, each with Fatihah), that's 5+8=13.",
    "But again, this is speculative.",
    "Alternatively, maybe I'm missing that the Fatihah is recited in each of the daily prayers multiple times.",
    "For example, in some prayers, the Fatihah is recited in each rakat.",
    "Wait, no.",
    "In each prayer, the Fatihah is recited once in the first rakat.",
    "So, regardless of the number of rakats, the Fatihah is once per prayer.",
    "I think I need to look up the standard number of recitations of the Fatihah.",
    "Wait, but since I can't access the internet, I'll have to rely on my knowledge.",
    "In the five daily prayers, the Fatihah is recited once each.",
    "That's five.",
    "If someone also prays the Witr prayer, that's one more.",
    "So, six.",
    "If they also pray the sunnah, that adds more.",
    "For example, in the sunnah before Fajr, two rakats with Fatihah.",
    "Similarly, after Fajr, two.",
    "So, that's four more.",
    "Similarly for other prayers.",
    "So, total of 5 (obligatory) + 4 (sunnah) + 1 (Witr) = 10.",
    "But this is getting to 10, not 17.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation in the funeral prayer.",
    "But that's not a daily occurrence.",
    "Hmm.",
    "I'm stuck.",
    "Let me think again.",
    "The answer options are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24.",
    "Wait, maybe the answer is (B) At least 17.",
    "Because the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day is 17.",
    "But how?",
    "Wait, perhaps the question is considering that in each of the daily prayers, the Fatihah is recited once, and each prayer has multiple rakats.",
    "For example, Fajr has 2 rakats, Dhuhr has 4, Asr has 4, Maghrib has 3, and Isha has 4.",
    "So, total rakats in daily prayers is 2+4+4+3+4=17.",
    "But the Fatihah is recited once in each prayer, not once per rakat.",
    "So, that would still be 5 times.",
    "So, this approach is wrong.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation in the Witr prayer.",
    "If someone prays Witr, that's an additional Fatihah.",
    "So, 5+1=6.",
    "Still not matching.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13.",
    "Because if someone prays all the sunnah prayers and the obligatory ones.",
    "Let's say 5 obligatory, plus 8 sunnah (like 2 before and after each of the five prayers), that would be 5+8=13.",
    "So, at least 13.",
    "But I'm not sure if that's accurate.",
    "I think the key here is that the question might be referring to the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day, which is five (obligatory prayers).",
    "But since that's not an option, maybe the answer expects considering some other practices.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation in the Witr prayer and other sunnah prayers, leading to a minimum of 13 or 17.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the answer is (B) At least 17.",
    "But I'm not sure.",
    "Given that the answer choices don't include 5, perhaps the correct answer is (B) At least 17, considering that in some Islamic traditions, there are more recitations.",
    "But I'm not certain.",
    "However, based on the options given, and the fact that the Fatihah is recited in each of the five daily prayers, and possibly in other prayers like Witr or sunnah, the minimum would be 5, but since 5 is not an option, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13.",
    "Wait, another angle: each time you pray, you recite the Fatihah once.",
    "The five daily prayers are five times.",
    "But in some prayers, like Isha, there are additional rakats.",
    "Wait, no, the Fatihah is still recited once per prayer.",
    "So, five times.",
    "But the options don't have that.",
    "Maybe the question is about the recitation during the entire day, including the night prayer.",
    "For example, if someone prays Witr, that's one more.",
    "So, 6.",
    "But again, no.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Exactly 24.",
    "That seems high.",
    "24 times?",
    "Maybe if someone prays all the prayers multiple times.",
    "But that doesn't make sense.",
    "I think I'm missing something here.",
    "Let me recall that in some Islamic schools of thought, the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five daily prayers, and in some cases, it's recited multiple times.",
    "But I can't recall a number like 17.",
    "Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation in the Tarawih prayers.",
    "For example, during Ramadan, Tarawih is 20 rakats, each with the Fatihah.",
    "So, 20.",
    "Adding to the five daily prayers, that's 25.",
    "But again, the question says \"a day\", not specifically Ramadan.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is (B) At least 17, considering that the minimum is 17.",
    "But without knowing the exact calculation, I'm not sure.",
    "Given that I'm stuck, maybe I should look at the options again.",
    "The answer choices are (A) Exactly 17, (B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24.",
    "If the Fatihah is recited in the five daily prayers, that's 5 times.",
    "If someone also prays the Witr prayer, that's 6.",
    "If they also pray the sunnah prayers, which can add more.",
    "For example, if each of the five prayers has 2 sunnah rakats before and after, that's 2*5*2=20.",
    "Adding to the obligatory 5, that's 25.",
    "But this seems too high.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the answer is (C) At least 13.",
    "If the minimum number is 5, but the options don't have that, maybe the correct answer is (C) At least 13, considering that in some cases, the Fatihah is recited more than once in a day.",
    "But I'm not sure.",
    "Given that I can't find a clear answer, but the options are given, I think the most plausible is (B) At least 17, assuming that the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited is 17.",
    "But I'm not confident.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13.",
    "Wait, perhaps the answer is (B) At least 17 because in some contexts, the Fatihah is recited multiple times.",
    "For example, in the five daily prayers, each with one Fatihah, that's 5.",
    "Then, if you include the Witr prayer, that's 6.",
    "And if you include the sunnah prayers, which can add more.",
    "For example, if someone prays 2 sunnah before and after each of the five prayers, that's 2*5=10.",
    "Adding to the 6, that's 16.",
    "Plus maybe some other prayers, making it 17.",
    "So, \"at least 17\" would be the correct answer.",
    "Therefore, the best answer is: (B)."

    "like during voluntary prayers or in some rituals.",
    "But the question might be referring to the obligatory prayers.",
    "Let's check that.",

    "Because if someone prays all the sunnah prayers and the obligatory ones.",
    "Let's say 5 obligatory,",
    "plus 8 sunnah",
    "(like 2 before and after each of the five prayers),",
    "that would be 5+8=13.",
    "So, at least 13.",
    "But I'm not sure if that's accurate.",
    "I think the key here is that the question might be referring to the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day,",
    "which is five (obligatory prayers).",
    "But since that's not an option,",
    "maybe the answer expects considering some other practices.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the recitation of the Fatihah in the daily prayers plus the recitation in the Witr prayer and other sunnah prayers,",
    "leading to a minimum of 13 or 17.",
    "Alternatively, perhaps the answer is (B) At least 17.",

    "maybe the answer is (C) At least 13.",
    "Wait, another angle:",

    "you recite the Fatihah once.",
    "The five daily prayers are five times.",
    "But in some prayers,",
    "like Isha, there are additional rakats.",
    "Wait, no, the Fatihah is still recited once per prayer.",
    "So, five times.",
    "But the options don't have that.",
    "Maybe the question is about the recitation during the entire day,",

    "I think I'm missing something here.",

    "the Fatihah is recited once in each of the five daily prayers,",
    "and in some cases,",
    "it's recited multiple times.",
    "But I can't recall a number like 17.",

    "(B) At least 17, (C) At least 13, (D) Exactly 24.",
    "If the Fatihah is recited in the five daily prayers,",
    "that's 5 times.",
    "If someone also prays the Witr prayer, that's 6.",
    "If they also pray the sunnah prayers,",
    "which can add more.",
    "For example, if each of the five prayers has 2 sunnah rakats before and after, that's 2*5*2=20.",
    "Adding to the obligatory 5, that's 25.",

    "Alternatively, perhaps the answer is (C) At least 13.",
    "If the minimum number is 5,",
    "but the options don't have that,",

    "Alternatively, maybe the answer is (C) At least 13.",
    "Wait, perhaps the answer is (B) At least 17 because in some contexts,",
    "the Fatihah is recited multiple times.",
    "For example, in the five daily prayers,",
    "each with one Fatihah, that's 5.",
    "Then, if you include the Witr prayer, that's 6.",
    "And if you include the sunnah prayers,",
    "which can add more.",
    "For example, if someone prays 2 sunnah before and after each of the five prayers, that's 2*5=10.",
    "Adding to the 6, that's 16.",
    "Plus maybe some other prayers,",
    "making it 17.",
