  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. The question is asking which theory is built around the principle that people make choices about their behavior based on values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, or Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let me start by breaking down each option. \n\nExpectancy theory comes to mind. I remember that Expectancy Theory, developed by Victor Vroom, is about how people's motivation is based on their expectations of outcomes. It involves three components: expectancy (the belief that effort leads to performance), instrumentality (the belief that performance leads to outcomes), and valence (the value placed on the outcomes). So, this theory does involve values and beliefs because valence is about the value of the outcomes, which relates to personal values. But does it specifically focus on how people choose behavior based on their values and beliefs? Maybe, but I need to check the other options.\n\nInstrumental conditioning is related to behaviorism, like Skinner's operant conditioning. Instrumental theory might refer to the idea that behaviors are learned through consequences. But the question mentions values and beliefs, which are more about internal factors rather than external consequences. So maybe Instrumental isn't the right fit here.\n\nClassical conditioning is about associations between stimuli, like Pavlov's dogs. That's more about automatic responses to stimuli, not about values or beliefs. So Classical is probably not the answer.\n\nContingency theory... I think that refers to theories that suggest outcomes depend on specific conditions. For example, in management, contingency theory suggests that there's no one-size-fits-all approach; it depends on the situation. But does that relate to values and beliefs? Maybe not directly. Contingency might be more about situational factors rather than internal values.\n\nGoing back to Expectancy Theory. The key here is that people's choices are based on their beliefs about how their actions will lead to outcomes and the value they place on those outcomes. So, if someone believes that working hard (their value) will lead to a promotion (outcome), they are more motivated. Therefore, values and beliefs (like valence in Expectancy Theory) play a role in their behavior choices. \n\nWait, but the question says \"based on values and beliefs\" as the principle. So, if the theory is about how people's choices are influenced by their values and beliefs, then Expectancy Theory might be the answer because it's about the expectation of outcomes and the value placed on them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Instrumental? Wait, Instrumental conditioning is a type of operant conditioning where behavior is influenced by consequences. But that's more about reinforcement and punishment, not necessarily values and beliefs. \n\nWait, there's also the concept of Instrumental Theory in organizational behavior, which might be related to how people choose actions based on expected outcomes. But I think that's part of Expectancy Theory. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Expectancy. Let me check again. The principle here is that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. Expectancy Theory does involve the idea that individuals evaluate the value of outcomes (valence) and the likelihood of achieving them (expectancy), so their choices are based on these beliefs. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be (A) Expectancy.\n",
