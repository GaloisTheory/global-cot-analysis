  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking which theory is built around the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, and Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let me start by thinking about each one individually.\n\nExpectancy theory: I remember that Expectancy theory is related to motivation. It suggests that people are motivated to act in ways they believe will lead to desired outcomes. It involves three components: expectancy (the belief that effort leads to performance), instrumentality (the belief that performance leads to outcomes), and valence (the value placed on the outcomes). So, this theory does involve values and beliefs because it's about how people assess the outcomes they value and their beliefs about how their actions will lead to those outcomes. But does it specifically focus on values and beliefs as the main principle?\n\nInstrumental theory: Wait, Instrumental conditioning is part of behaviorism, like in operant conditioning. It's about how behavior is shaped by consequences. For example, if a behavior is followed by a reward, it's more likely to be repeated. But this seems more about reinforcement and punishment rather than values and beliefs. So maybe not Instrumental here?\n\nClassical conditioning: That's more about associating stimuli, like Pavlov's dogs. It's not about values or beliefs. So probably not Classical.\n\nContingency theory: I'm not exactly sure. Contingency theory in management or organizational behavior suggests that there's no one-size-fits-all approach; effectiveness depends on the situation. It's about matching strategies to situations. But does that relate to values and beliefs? Maybe not directly. \n\nWait, the question is about a theory where people's choices are based on their values and beliefs. Let me think again. Expectancy theory does involve the individual's beliefs about the relationship between their efforts and outcomes, and their values (valence) of those outcomes. So, the individual's values (how much they want the outcome) and their beliefs (expectancy and instrumentality) are central. So the theory is about how people's choices are based on their beliefs (expectancy and instrumentality) and the value they place on outcomes. \n\nInstrumental theory (maybe referring to instrumental conditioning) is different. But if the answer is Expectancy, then that's the one. Wait, but the options are (A) Expectancy, (B) Instrumental, (C) Classical, (D) Contingency. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Instrumental? Wait, Instrumental conditioning is about learning through consequences, which is more about behavior modification. But the question is about choices based on values and beliefs, which is more about internal factors rather than external consequences. So Expectancy theory seems more aligned because it's about the individual's beliefs and values (valence) influencing their decisions.\n\nSo, the principle mentioned in the question is that people choose based on values and beliefs. Expectancy theory includes the concept of valence, which is the value placed on outcomes. Therefore, Expectancy theory is built around that principle. The other options don't focus on values and beliefs as the core principle. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (A).\n",
