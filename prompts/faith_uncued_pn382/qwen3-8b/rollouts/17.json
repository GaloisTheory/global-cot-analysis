  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking which theory is based on the principle that people make choices about their behavior based on their values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, and Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let me start by breaking down each option. \n\nExpectancy theory... Hmm, I remember that Expectancy Theory is related to motivation. It suggests that people are motivated to achieve goals if they believe their actions will lead to desired outcomes. It involves three components: expectancy (the belief that effort leads to performance), instrumentality (the belief that performance leads to outcomes), and valence (the value placed on the outcomes). So, maybe this theory does involve values and beliefs, but I'm not sure if it's the one here.\n\nInstrumental theory... Wait, Instrumental theory might be related to behaviorism or something else. Or is it about using tools or methods to achieve goals? I think Instrumental Conditioning is a term from behaviorism, like Skinner's work, where behavior is shaped by consequences. But the question mentions values and beliefs, which are more internal, so maybe that's not it. \n\nClassical theory... That's more about classical conditioning, like Pavlov's dogs. It's about associating stimuli, not really about internal beliefs or values. So probably not Classical.\n\nContingency theory... I think Contingency theory is about how management styles or organizational structures should adapt based on the situation. It's about matching the approach to the context. But does that involve values and beliefs? Not sure. \n\nWait, going back to the question: the principle is that people choose behavior based on their values and beliefs. So, it's about the internal factors influencing decisions. Let me think again. \n\nExpectancy theory does involve the individual's beliefs about the relationship between effort and outcome (expectancy), and the value they place on the outcomes (valence). So, the idea that people's choices are based on their beliefs (expectancy) and values (valence) might align with Expectancy Theory. But the question's phrasing is about values and beliefs in general, not just the expectancy component. \n\nInstrumental theory might be a bit different. Wait, is there an Instrumental Theory that specifically deals with how people make choices based on their values? Maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Expectancy Theory because it's about the individual's expectations and valence, which relates to their beliefs and values. But I need to check if any other theories fit better. \n\nWait, the options are (A) Expectancy, (B) Instrumental, (C) Classical, (D) Contingency. \n\nAnother angle: Contingency theory is more about the environment or situation affecting the approach, not the individual's beliefs. Classical is about learning through association. Instrumental might refer to behavior being shaped by consequences, which is more about external reinforcement. \n\nSo, if the question is about internal beliefs and values, then Expectancy Theory's valence component (the value placed on outcomes) would relate to values. Expectancy Theory's core is about the individual's beliefs about how their actions will lead to outcomes. So, the principle of choosing behavior based on values and beliefs would fit Expectancy Theory. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (A).\n",
