  "cot_content": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which theory is based on the principle that people make choices about their behavior based on values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, and Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let me start by breaking down each option.\n\nExpectancy theory: I remember that expectancy theory is related to motivation. It suggests that people are motivated to act in ways they believe will lead to desired outcomes. It involves three components: expectancy (the belief that effort leads to performance), instrumentality (performance leads to outcomes), and valence (the value placed on the outcomes). So, this theory does involve values and beliefs because the valence part is about the value of the outcomes. But does it directly focus on how people choose behavior based on their values and beliefs? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nInstrumental theory: Wait, instrumental conditioning is more about learning through consequences. Like operant conditioning where behaviors are shaped by rewards or punishments. But the term \"instrumental\" might also refer to something else. However, the question mentions values and beliefs. Instrumental theory might be more about the consequences rather than internal beliefs. Not sure yet.\n\nClassical conditioning: That's more about associating stimuli with responses, like Pavlov's dogs. It's about automatic responses, not really about values or beliefs. So probably not this one.\n\nContingency theory: This is about how different situations require different management approaches. It's about matching the situation to the appropriate action. But does it involve values and beliefs? Maybe not directly. It's more about the context or contingency factors affecting behavior.\n\nGoing back to the original question: the key point is that people choose behavior based on their values and beliefs. So, which theory deals with that?\n\nExpectancy theory's valence component does involve the value placed on outcomes, so if someone has certain values, they choose actions that align with those values. But does the theory itself center around that principle? Alternatively, maybe the answer is Instrumental. Wait, instrumental theory (as in instrumental conditioning) is about using behavior to achieve goals, which could relate to values. But I'm confused between Expectancy and Instrumental here.\n\nWait, another angle: the question says \"values and beliefs\" influence choices. Which theory emphasizes that? In social psychology, there's the theory of reasoned action, which posits that behavior is determined by behavioral intentions, which are influenced by attitudes (values/beliefs) and subjective norms. But that's not one of the options here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Expectancy. Because the expectancy theory includes valence, which is about the value of outcomes. So when people choose behaviors, they consider what they value (valence) and whether their effort will lead to that outcome (expectancy). Therefore, the theory is built around the idea that people make choices based on their beliefs (expectancy) and values (valence). \n\nBut wait, the options are (A) Expectancy, (B) Instrumental. Let me check again. \n\nInstrumental theory might be a distractor. If the question is about choices based on values and beliefs, then Expectancy theory's valence component fits. However, sometimes \"instrumental\" is used in other contexts. For example, in organizational theory, instrumental variables are used, but that's not relevant here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (B) Instrumental. Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from different theories. For instance, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) includes attitudes (which are related to values and beliefs) as a factor in predicting behavior. But again, TPB isn't listed. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the options given, the best fit might be (A) Expectancy. Because the Expectancy theory does involve the individual's beliefs about the likelihood of achieving outcomes (expectancy) and the value they place on those outcomes (valence). Thus, the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs is central to Expectancy theory. \n\nSo, after considering all options, I think the correct answer is (A) Expectancy.",
