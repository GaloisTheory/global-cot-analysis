  "cot_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which theory is based on the principle that people make choices about their behavior based on values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, or Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let me start by breaking down each option.\n\nExpectancy theory... I think that's related to motivation. It's about people's expectations of outcomes. Like, if they expect a certain result from an action, they're more likely to do it. But does that involve values and beliefs? Maybe not directly. It's more about expectancy and the value of the outcome. Wait, but maybe it's part of the broader idea that people choose based on what they think will happen and whether they value that outcome. Not sure yet.\n\nInstrumental theory... Hmm. Instrumental conditioning is like operant conditioning, where behavior is shaped by consequences. For example, if you get a reward for doing something, you're more likely to repeat it. But again, does this focus on values and beliefs? Or is it more about consequences and reinforcement?\n\nClassical conditioning is about associating stimuli, like Pavlov's dogs. That's more about automatic responses, not really about choices based on values. So probably not this one.\n\nContingency theory... I remember that contingency theory in management or organizational behavior suggests that there's no one-size-fits-all approach; the best strategy depends on the situation. But how does that relate to values and beliefs? Maybe not directly. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up different theories here.\n\nWait, the question is about the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. Which theory emphasizes that? Let me think again. Values and beliefs are part of the individual's internal framework. So maybe theories that focus on personal motivations or cognitive aspects?\n\nExpectancy theory might be closer because it involves the individual's expectations (which could be tied to their beliefs) and the valence of outcomes (which relates to values). For instance, if someone believes that working hard will lead to success (expectation) and values success (belief), they'll choose to work hard. So maybe Expectancy theory fits here.\n\nBut wait, another thought: Instrumental theory could also be related. Wait, instrumental conditioning is about using actions to achieve outcomes, which might involve valuing those outcomes. However, instrumental theory is more about the learning process through reinforcement, not necessarily about internal values and beliefs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Expectancy. Let me check definitions again. Expectancy theory posits that individuals are motivated by their expectations of achieving desired outcomes. If they believe that their actions will lead to a valued outcome, they'll act accordingly. So that seems to align with the principle mentioned in the question.\n\nClassical conditioning is not about choice, so that's out. Contingency theory is more about situational factors. So the answer is probably A) Expectancy.",
