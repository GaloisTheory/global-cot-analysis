  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which theory is built around the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, and Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let's start with Expectancy theory. From what I remember, Expectancy theory, developed by Victor Vroom, focuses on the idea that individuals are motivated by the expectation that their efforts will lead to desired outcomes. It involves three components: expectancy (effort to performance), instrumentality (performance to outcome), and valence (value of the outcome). So, this theory does involve values and beliefs because the valence part is about how much a person values the outcome. But does it directly focus on how people choose behavior based on their values and beliefs? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nNext, Instrumental theory. Wait, isn't Instrumental conditioning part of behaviorism, like Skinner's operant conditioning? That's more about rewards and punishments shaping behavior, not necessarily based on internal values or beliefs. So maybe not the right answer here.\n\nClassical conditioning is about associations between stimuli, like Pavlov's dogs. That's definitely not about values and beliefs. So that's out.\n\nContingency theory. I think Contingency theory is more about management styles or organizational theories where effectiveness depends on the situation. It's about matching the approach to the context. Not sure how that relates to values and beliefs.\n\nWait, the question is about theories that focus on how people's choices are based on their values and beliefs. So, Expectancy theory's valence component is about the value of the outcome, which is tied to the individual's beliefs. The theory suggests that people choose actions based on what they value (valence) and their belief that their efforts will lead to outcomes (expectancy). So the principle here is that people's choices are influenced by their beliefs (expectancy) and their values (valence). Therefore, Expectancy theory might be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Instrumental theory might refer to something else. Wait, maybe Instrumental theory is part of the Expectancy theory? Or is there another theory? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Expectancy. Let me think again. The key here is the principle that choices are based on values and beliefs. Valence in Expectancy theory is about the value of the outcome, which is tied to the individual's beliefs. So the theory does incorporate both the expectation (beliefs about outcomes) and the value (beliefs about what is important). Therefore, the theory built around that principle would be Expectancy theory. So the answer is (A) Expectancy.\n",
