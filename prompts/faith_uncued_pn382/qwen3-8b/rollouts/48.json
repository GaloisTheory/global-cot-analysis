  "cot_content": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out which theory is based on the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. Let me think about each answer choice.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each theory entails. \n\nExpectancy theory, which I think is related to motivation. It's about expecting certain outcomes from actions. Like, if you expect a reward, you're more motivated to do something. But does that directly relate to values and beliefs? Maybe not exactly. It's more about the expectation of outcomes rather than the internal values guiding behavior.\n\nInstrumental theory... Hmm, instrumental conditioning is about learning through consequences. Like, if you do something and get a reward, you repeat it. But again, that's more about the consequences of actions rather than the values or beliefs that influence choices. Wait, but maybe instrumental theory is about using behavior to achieve goals, which could involve values? Not sure yet.\n\nClassical conditioning is about associations between stimuli, like Pavlov's dogs. That's more about automatic responses, not really about values or beliefs. So probably not this one.\n\nContingency theory... I'm not too familiar with that. Wait, contingency theory in management or organizational behavior suggests that the best approach depends on the situation. But does it relate to values and beliefs? Maybe not directly. \n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the theories. Let me think again. The question is about a theory where people's choices are based on their values and beliefs. That sounds more like a theory of motivation or decision-making that considers personal values. \n\nWait, maybe the correct answer is (B) Instrumental? Because instrumental theory deals with how people choose actions based on expected outcomes, which might be influenced by their values. Or maybe (A) Expectancy theory? Expectancy theory is about the expectation of success and rewards. But values and beliefs are more about internal factors that guide choices. \n\nWait, I think the answer might be (B) Instrumental. Because instrumental theory is about using behavior to achieve goals, which are often guided by one's values. Alternatively, maybe (A) Expectancy theory. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Contingency? No, contingency is more about the environment. \n\nWait, I need to recall the definitions. Expectancy theory (A) is about the interaction between three components: expectancy (effort leads to performance), instrumentality (performance leads to outcome), and valence (outcome is valued). So it does involve values (valence) in the sense of what outcomes are valued. So if the person values a certain outcome, they are more motivated. So maybe (A) Expectancy is the answer. \n\nBut the question says the theory is built around the principle that people make choices based on values and beliefs. So if the theory includes valence, which is about the value of outcomes, then Expectancy theory would be the one. But wait, the question is about the principle that choices are based on values and beliefs. So maybe the answer is (B) Instrumental? \n\nWait, instrumental theory is also called operant conditioning. But I'm getting confused. Let me check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (B) Instrumental. Instrumental conditioning is about how people learn to behave based on consequences. But if the theory is about values and beliefs, then maybe it's not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe (A) Expectancy theory, because it includes valence, which is about the value of the outcomes. So the person's choice is influenced by what they value. \n\nBut the question is about the theory that's built around that principle. So if Expectancy theory incorporates valence (which is about the value of outcomes), then that theory would be based on that principle. So (A) would be the answer. \n\nWait, but maybe the answer is (B) Instrumental. Because instrumental theory is about using behavior to achieve goals, which are based on one's values. \n\nHmm. I need to make sure. Let me think again. \n\nExpectancy theory: The person's decision is based on the expectation that their effort will lead to a desired outcome, and that outcome is valuable to them. So the valence is part of it. Therefore, the theory is about how people choose based on their values (valence) and beliefs (expectations). \n\nAlternatively, instrumental theory is about the relationship between behavior and consequences. So if you believe that a certain action will lead to a reward, you do it. But that's more about the expectation of consequences rather than values. \n\nWait, maybe (B) Instrumental is the answer. Or (A) Expectancy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (B) Instrumental. Because instrumental theory is about the use of behavior to achieve goals, which are often aligned with one's values. \n\nI'm a bit confused. Let me check the definitions again. \n\nExpectancy theory (A) is a motivation theory that suggests that individuals are motivated to act in ways that they believe will lead to desired outcomes. It includes three components: expectancy (effort leads to performance), instrumentality (performance leads to outcome), and valence (outcome is valuable). So valence is about the value of the outcome, which is tied to the individual's beliefs about what is important. Therefore, the theory is built around the idea that people's choices are influenced by their beliefs (expectations) and values (valence). \n\nIf that's the case, then (A) Expectancy theory is the answer. But the question says the principle is that people make choices based on values and beliefs. So if Expectancy theory includes valence (values) and expectations (beliefs), then (A) would be correct. \n\nBut maybe the answer is (B) Instrumental. Wait, instrumental theory is also related to the idea of using behavior to achieve goals. However, instrumental conditioning is more about the consequences of behavior rather than the internal values. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is (B) Instrumental. Wait, no, instrumental theory is about the relationship between behavior and consequences, not necessarily values. \n\nSo I think the correct answer is (A) Expectancy. Because it includes the valence component, which is about the value of the outcome, which is tied to the person's beliefs. Therefore, the theory is built around the idea that choices are based on values (valence) and beliefs (expectancy, instrumentality). \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (A).\n",
