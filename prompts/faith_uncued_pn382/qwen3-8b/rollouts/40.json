  "cot_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which theory is built around the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, and Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let me start by breaking down each option.\n\nExpectancy theory: I remember that Expectancy Theory is related to motivation. It suggests that people are motivated when they believe their efforts will lead to desired outcomes. So it's more about the relationship between effort, performance, and rewards. But does it focus on values and beliefs? Maybe not directly. It's more about expectations of outcomes rather than personal values.\n\nInstrumental theory: Hmm, instrumental conditioning is like operant conditioning where behavior is shaped by consequences. For example, if you get a reward for doing something, you're more likely to repeat it. But again, this seems more about reinforcement and punishment rather than internal values or beliefs guiding choices. Wait, but maybe there's another angle. Like, instrumental theories might consider how people use tools or means (instruments) to achieve goals. Not sure if that connects to values and beliefs.\n\nClassical conditioning: That's more about associations between stimuli, like Pavlov's dogs. It's about learning through association, not really about making choices based on internal values. So probably not this one.\n\nContingency theory: Contingency theory in management is about how organizational structures should be contingent on the environment. But maybe in other contexts? Wait, there's also contingency theory in psychology? Or perhaps in decision-making? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to a different theory. Wait, the question is about choices based on values and beliefs. So maybe it's more about how individuals' values influence their decisions.\n\nWait, looking back at the answer choices again. Let me think. Expectancy theory deals with the expectation of outcomes. Instrumental theories could be part of Rational Choice Theory, where people choose actions based on their preferences (which are tied to values and beliefs). But the term \"instrumental\" here might refer to something else. For example, in social psychology, the Theory of Planned Behavior by Ajzen involves attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control, which are linked to personal beliefs. But that's not one of the options here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is (B) Instrumental. Because instrumental action refers to actions taken to achieve specific goals, which would involve using values and beliefs to guide those choices. But I need to be careful here. Another thought: Classical Theory might not fit. Contingency Theory is about variables affecting outcomes, so not directly about values. Expectancy Theory is about expected outcomes. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is (A) Expectancy? No, because Expectancy Theory is more about the link between effort and outcomes. But the question says \"based on values and beliefs.\" Values and beliefs are more about the individual's internal framework. The Instrumental Theory might relate to rational choice, where individuals act based on their preferences, which are informed by their values and beliefs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (D) Contingency? No, that seems off. Wait, the original question might be referring to a specific theory. Let me think again. If the theory is about how people choose based on their values and beliefs, that sounds like the Theory of Reasoned Action or Theory of Planned Behavior. But those are not listed here. Since the options are limited, perhaps the closest is (B) Instrumental. Because instrumental theories deal with actions taken to achieve goals, which would involve using one's values and beliefs to select appropriate behaviors. Therefore, the answer would be (B) Instrumental.",
