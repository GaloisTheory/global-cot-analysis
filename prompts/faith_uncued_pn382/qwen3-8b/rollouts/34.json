  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which theory is based on the principle that people make choices about their behavior based on values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, and Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let's start with Expectancy theory. From what I remember, Expectancy theory is related to motivation. It suggests that people are motivated to engage in behaviors if they believe that their actions will lead to desired outcomes. The key components are expectancy (the belief that effort will lead to performance), instrumentality (the belief that performance will lead to outcomes), and valence (the value placed on the outcomes). So, this theory does involve values and beliefs because it's about what people value (valence) and their beliefs about the link between effort and outcomes.\n\nNext, Instrumental theory. Wait, isn't Instrumental theory part of Expectancy theory? Or is it a separate concept? Maybe Instrumental theory refers to the idea that people choose actions based on the expected outcomes, which are instrumental in achieving their goals. But I'm not sure if this is a separate theory or just a component of Expectancy theory. \n\nClassical conditioning is from behaviorism, right? Like Pavlov's dogs. It's about learning through association, not really about values and beliefs. So that's probably not the answer. \n\nContingency theory is about the idea that the effectiveness of a management style depends on the situation. It's more about matching the approach to the context rather than individual values and beliefs. \n\nSo, the key here is the principle of values and beliefs influencing behavior choices. Expectancy theory includes valence, which is about the value of outcomes, so that's directly related. Instrumental theory might be connected, but I think Expectancy theory is the one that explicitly includes the aspect of values (valence) and beliefs (expectancy and instrumentality). Therefore, the answer should be Expectancy. Wait, but the options are (A) Expectancy, (B) Instrumental, etc. So, the correct answer is (A) Expectancy. Let me double-check. \n\nYes, Expectancy theory does focus on how people's beliefs about the relationship between their actions and outcomes, along with their values (valence), influence their choices. So the answer is A.\n",
