  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is asking which theory is based on the principle that people make choices about their behavior based on their values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, and Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let me start by breaking down each option.\n\nExpectancy theory... I remember that's related to motivation. It suggests that people are motivated to act in a certain way if they believe their actions will lead to a desired outcome. So it's about the expectation of outcomes. But does it involve values and beliefs? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the main focus here.\n\nInstrumental conditioning, which is part of behaviorism. That's more about learning through rewards and punishments. Like, if you do something and get a reward, you're more likely to repeat it. But again, this is more about consequences rather than internal values or beliefs. So maybe not this one.\n\nClassical conditioning is about associating stimuli. Like Pavlov's dogs. That's not really about choices based on values, so probably not.\n\nContingency theory... Wait, contingency theory is about how different situations require different approaches. It's more about adapting strategies based on the situation. But I'm not certain how that connects to values and beliefs. Wait, maybe not. \n\nWait, the question is about choices based on values and beliefs. So, maybe another theory. But the options given are these four. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is Expectancy? Because in Expectancy theory, people's expectations and their beliefs about the outcomes influence their behavior. But the question mentions values and beliefs. Wait, values are part of the individual's internal framework. Maybe it's more about the Expectancy theory. But I'm a bit confused because the options might not directly match. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the Theory of Planned Behavior, but that's not listed here. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, Contingency. \n\nWait, Instrumental conditioning is a type of learning, but the question is about choices based on values. Maybe the answer is Expectancy. Because Expectancy theory is about the expectation of outcomes, which could be influenced by one's values and beliefs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is not listed here. But since the options are given, I have to choose between them. \n\nWait, another angle: Contingency theory. Wait, Contingency theory is about the effectiveness of leadership styles depending on the situation. That doesn't fit. \n\nInstrumental conditioning is about learning through rewards. So if someone believes that a certain action will lead to a reward (based on their values), they might choose that action. But the theory itself is about learning through reinforcement, not necessarily about values. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is Expectancy. Because Expectancy theory (as in the Expectancy theory of motivation) does involve the individual's beliefs about the relationship between their actions and outcomes. So if someone values a certain outcome, they might believe that their actions can lead to it, thus choosing that behavior. So the principle here is that people's choices are based on their beliefs (expectations) about how their actions will lead to outcomes. \n\nWait, but the question says \"values and beliefs.\" So maybe the answer is Expectancy? Because the theory of expectancy is about the person's expectations, which are influenced by their beliefs. Or maybe it's another theory. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Instrumental, but that seems more about external reinforcement. \n\nI think I need to confirm. Let me think again. Expectancy theory (also called the Expectancy Theory of Motivation) by Victor Vroom states that motivation is a function of three components: expectancy (the belief that effort will lead to performance), instrumentality (the belief that performance will lead to outcomes), and valence (the value placed on the outcomes). So, the theory does involve values (valence) and beliefs (expectancy and instrumentality). Therefore, the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs is part of the Expectancy theory. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be (A) Expectancy.\n",
