  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which theory is based on the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, and Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let me start by breaking down each option.\n\nExpectancy theory, I remember, is related to motivation. It suggests that people are motivated when they believe their efforts will lead to desired outcomes. It's about the expectation of success and the value of the outcome. But does it focus on values and beliefs? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the main focus.\n\nInstrumental theory... Wait, instrumental conditioning is part of behaviorism. It's about learning through consequences, like rewards and punishments. That's more about the consequences of actions rather than the internal values or beliefs of the person. So maybe not this one.\n\nClassical conditioning, like Pavlov's dogs, is about associating stimuli with responses. That's about automatic responses, not about personal values or beliefs. So probably not this either.\n\nContingency theory... Hmm. Contingency theory in management or organizational behavior suggests that there's no one-size-fits-all approach; effectiveness depends on the situation. But does that relate to values and beliefs? I'm not certain. Wait, maybe the question is referring to a different context. Alternatively, maybe it's about the theory that people's behavior is contingent on their values and beliefs. But I'm not sure if that's one of the options here.\n\nWait, the question is about a theory where people make choices based on their values and beliefs. Let me think again. Expectancy theory does involve personal beliefs about the likelihood of outcomes. For example, if someone believes that their effort will lead to a good result (expectancy) and that the result is valuable (valence), they're motivated. But does that directly tie into values and beliefs? Maybe. \n\nAlternatively, there's the Theory of Planned Behavior by Ajzen, which incorporates attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. But that's not one of the answer choices. The options given are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, and Contingency.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is Expectancy. Because Expectancy theory does consider the individual's beliefs about the relationship between their actions and outcomes. For instance, the expectancy component is the belief that effort leads to performance, and the instrumentality is the belief that performance leads to outcomes. Valence is the value placed on the outcome. So if the question is about values and beliefs, maybe Expectancy theory is the one that includes these aspects. \n\nBut the options are (A) Expectancy, (B) Instrumental, etc. Wait, Instrumental theory might refer to Instrumental Conditioning, which is part of behaviorism. But the question is about choices based on values and beliefs, which sounds more like cognitive or motivational theories rather than behaviorist ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (B) Instrumental? Wait, no. Instrumental conditioning is about learning through rewards, not about internal beliefs. \n\nClassical conditioning is about associations, not choices based on beliefs. Contingency theory in management is about matching strategies to situations. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is Expectancy. Because Expectancy theory involves the individual's beliefs about how their actions will lead to outcomes, which is part of their decision-making process. The principle here is that people make choices based on their expectations (which can be linked to their values and beliefs). \n\nSo, considering all that, the best answer seems to be (A) Expectancy.\n",
