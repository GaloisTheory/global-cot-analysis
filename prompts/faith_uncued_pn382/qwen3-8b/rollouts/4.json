  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out this question. The question is asking which theory is based on the principle that people make choices about their behavior based on values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, and Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let me start by breaking down each option.\n\nExpectancy theory... I remember that's related to motivation. It's about the expectation that if you put in effort, you'll achieve a certain outcome. The formula is something like Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence. But wait, the question here is about values and beliefs. Valence in Expectancy theory refers to how much someone values the outcome, so maybe that's related? But the main focus of Expectancy theory is on the expectation of outcomes rather than values and beliefs as the basis for choices.\n\nInstrumental theory... Hmm, instrumental conditioning is associated with behaviorism, like B.F. Skinner's work. It's about learning through rewards and punishments. So, people's behavior is shaped by the consequences they receive. But the question mentions values and beliefs, which are more internal and about personal beliefs rather than external consequences. So maybe Instrumental isn't the right fit here.\n\nClassical conditioning is another behaviorist theory, like Pavlov's dogs. It's about associating a neutral stimulus with a meaningful one. That's more about automatic responses, not about choices based on values and beliefs. So probably not Classical.\n\nContingency theory... Wait, contingency theory is about how effectiveness of a management style depends on the situation. But I'm not sure if that's directly related to individual values and beliefs. Or maybe there's another type of contingency theory? Wait, maybe in organizational behavior, contingency theory refers to how different factors affect the choice of management practices. But the question is about people's choices based on their own values and beliefs, not organizational factors. \n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up theories. Let me think again. The key here is that people's behavior is influenced by their values and beliefs. So, which theory emphasizes that people make decisions based on their internal values and beliefs? \n\nExpectancy theory does involve valence, which is the value of the outcome. But the core of Expectancy theory is about the expectation that effort leads to performance, which leads to outcomes. Valence is part of it, but the main idea isn't about values and beliefs as the driving force. \n\nInstrumental theory might be more about using behavior to achieve goals, but again, that's more about reinforcement. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is Expectancy? Because the valence component relates to the value of the outcome. But the question says \"values and beliefs\" as the basis for choices. Valence in Expectancy theory is about the value of the outcome, so maybe that's part of the theory. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Instrumental? Or perhaps the question is referring to a different theory. Wait, let me check the options again. The options are (A) Expectancy, (B) Instrumental, (C) Classical, (D) Contingency. \n\nAnother angle: values and beliefs are part of the decision-making process. So when someone chooses behavior, they consider what they value. That sounds like it's related to Expectancy theory's valence, but maybe another theory. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is (B) Instrumental? Because instrumental conditioning involves using behavior to achieve desired outcomes, which could be based on the person's beliefs about what's valuable. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (A) Expectancy. Because in Expectancy theory, the individual's beliefs about the likelihood of achieving outcomes (expectancy) and the value of the outcomes (valence) influence their choices. So the theory is built around the idea that people's choices are based on their beliefs (expectancy) and values (valence). \n\nTherefore, the best answer would be (A) Expectancy. But wait, the question says \"values and beliefs\" as the principle. Valence is part of the Expectancy theory. So maybe that's the one. \n\nAlternatively, is there another theory? Maybe the answer is (D) Contingency? No, contingency theory is more about situational factors. \n\nSo, after thinking through, I think the answer is (A) Expectancy. Because the theory incorporates both the expectation of outcomes and the value placed on those outcomes, which relates to values and beliefs.\n",
