  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which theory is based on the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, and Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let me start by breaking down each option.\n\nExpectancy theory, I think, is related to motivation. It suggests that people are motivated to achieve goals if they believe their actions will lead to desired outcomes. The key here is the expectation of outcomes. But does that involve values and beliefs? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the core principle.\n\nInstrumental theory... wait, instrumental conditioning is part of behaviorism, right? Like Skinner's work. It's about learning through consequences, such as rewards and punishments. So people adjust their behavior based on what they get. But again, does that focus on values and beliefs? Maybe not directly. It's more about external reinforcement.\n\nClassical conditioning is another behaviorist theory, like Pavlov's dogs. It's about associating stimuli with responses. That's more about automatic responses rather than choices based on internal values or beliefs. So probably not this one.\n\nContingency theory... Hmm. Contingency theory might be related to how different situations require different management approaches. But I'm not sure. Wait, there's also the contingency theory in organizational behavior, which suggests that the effectiveness of management styles depends on the situation. But does that involve values and beliefs?\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up theories. Let me think again. The question is about a theory where people choose behavior based on their values and beliefs. That sounds more like the theory of planned behavior, which is part of social psychology. But that's not listed here. The options given are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, Contingency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's Expectancy theory. Wait, in the context of organizational behavior, Expectancy theory (also known as the Expectancy Theory of Motivation) posits that individuals are motivated to act if they believe that their actions will lead to desired outcomes. But does that involve values and beliefs? The theory does mention that people's expectations about outcomes influence their behavior, but values and beliefs might be part of their perception of those outcomes. However, I'm not certain if that's the primary focus.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Instrumental theory. Wait, instrumental theory could refer to the concept of instrumental conditioning, which is about learning through rewards and punishments. But again, that's more about external reinforcement rather than personal values.\n\nWait, the key here is that the theory is built around the idea that people make choices based on their own values and beliefs. So perhaps the answer is Expectancy theory because it's about the individual's expectations and beliefs about the outcomes of their actions. But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Contingency theory, but I'm not sure. Let me think of another angle. Values and beliefs are internal factors that influence decision-making. Expectancy theory involves the individual's expectations, which are part of their beliefs about what will happen. So if someone believes that a certain action will lead to a desired outcome (based on their values), they are more likely to choose that action. That seems to align with Expectancy theory. However, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Instrumental theory, but I think that's more about the consequences rather than the internal beliefs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is not listed, but given the options, the best fit is Expectancy. Wait, but I need to be careful. Let me check the definitions again. \n\nExpectancy theory: Motivation is based on the expectation that effort will lead to performance, which leads to outcomes that are valued. So it's about the individual's beliefs about the relationship between effort and outcomes, and their valuing of those outcomes. That does involve values and beliefs. So the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs might align with Expectancy theory. \n\nAlternatively, Instrumental conditioning is about learning through consequences, which is more about external rewards, not necessarily internal values. \n\nClassical conditioning is about associations, not choices based on internal beliefs. \n\nContingency theory is about the fit between the organization and the environment, not about individual choices based on values. \n\nSo the best fit seems to be Expectancy (A). Wait, but the answer options are (A) Expectancy, (B) Instrumental, (C) Classical, (D) Contingency. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Expectancy.\n",
