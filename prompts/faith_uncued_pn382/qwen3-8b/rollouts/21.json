  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking which theory is built around the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, and Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let me start by thinking about each one. \n\nExpectancy theory, if I remember correctly, is related to motivation. It suggests that people are motivated to achieve goals if they believe their actions will lead to desired outcomes. It involves the expectancy of success and the value of the outcome. But does it focus on values and beliefs? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the main focus.\n\nInstrumental conditioning, like in behaviorism, is about learning through consequences. For example, if a behavior is followed by a reward, it's more likely to be repeated. But this seems more about reinforcement and punishment rather than internal values and beliefs. So maybe not Instrumental.\n\nClassical conditioning is about associating stimuli, like Pavlov's dogs. That's more about automatic responses to stimuli, not about personal values or beliefs. So probably not Classical.\n\nContingency theory... Hmm. Contingency theory in management or organizational behavior suggests that there's no one-size-fits-all approach; effectiveness depends on the situation. But how does that relate to values and beliefs? Maybe not directly. Wait, but maybe there's another angle. Wait, the question might be referring to a different theory. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question is about a theory where choices are based on values and beliefs. So, perhaps it's about how people's internal values influence their decisions. Let me think about theories in psychology or social sciences. \n\nExpectancy theory does involve individual's beliefs about the likelihood of outcomes, but it's more about the expectancy of success and the valence of the outcome. But maybe the question is pointing towards a theory that emphasizes the role of personal values and beliefs in decision-making. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the Instrumental theory. Wait, instrumental conditioning is about learning through consequences, not values. But maybe there's another theory. Wait, maybe the answer is Expectancy. Because in expectancy theory, people's choices are based on their expectations of outcomes, which could be influenced by their values and beliefs. \n\nWait, but the options are (A) Expectancy, (B) Instrumental, (C) Classical, (D) Contingency. Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is Expectancy. Because the expectancy theory is about how people choose actions based on their expectations of outcomes, which could be tied to their values. But I'm not 100% sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the Contingency theory. But contingency theory is more about the situation affecting the approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Instrumental. Wait, instrumental theory is part of behaviorism, where actions are taken to achieve goals. But that's more about the consequences rather than internal values. \n\nWait, the key is that the theory is built around the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. So, perhaps it's a theory that emphasizes internal motivation and personal values. \n\nWait, let me think again. The Expectancy theory, as per Vroom, states that motivation is based on the expectation that effort will lead to performance, which leads to outcomes, and that the outcomes are valuable. So, the value of the outcome is tied to the individual's beliefs. So, values and beliefs are part of the valence in expectancy theory. Therefore, the answer could be Expectancy. \n\nBut wait, maybe the answer is Instrumental. Wait, Instrumental conditioning is more about the reinforcement, not the internal values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Contingency. No, contingency theory is more about the situation. \n\nWait, the options given are (A) Expectancy, (B) Instrumental, (C) Classical, (D) Contingency. \n\nI think the answer is Expectancy theory. Because the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs aligns with the idea that the outcome's value (valence) is part of the expectancy theory. So, people choose actions based on their expectations and the value they assign to the outcomes, which is influenced by their beliefs and values. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is (A) Expectancy.\n",
