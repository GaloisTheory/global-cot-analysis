  "cot_content": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The question is asking which theory is built around the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. The options are Expectancy, Instrumental, Classical, and Contingency.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories entails. Let's start with Expectancy theory. From what I remember, Expectancy theory, developed by Victor Vroom, focuses on how individuals choose behaviors based on the expected outcomes. It involves three components: expectancy (the belief that effort leads to performance), instrumentality (performance leads to outcomes), and valence (the value placed on the outcomes). So, this theory does involve values and beliefs because valence is about the value of the outcomes, which relates to personal beliefs.\n\nNext, Instrumental theory. Wait, Instrumental conditioning is a concept from behaviorism, like in B.F. Skinner's work. It's about learning through consequences, such as rewards and punishments. This seems more about behavior being shaped by external stimuli rather than internal values and beliefs. So maybe not this one.\n\nClassical conditioning is also from behaviorism, where associations are formed between stimuli and responses, like Pavlov's dogs. That's more about automatic responses, not based on personal values or beliefs. So probably not Classical.\n\nContingency theory. I think Contingency theory is more about how different management styles or strategies are effective under certain conditions. It's about matching the approach to the situation. But does it involve values and beliefs? Not sure. It's more about situational factors rather than individual values.\n\nSo the key here is the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. Expectancy theory's valence part directly relates to the value placed on outcomes, which is a belief. Instrumental theory is more about external reinforcement, not internal values. Classical is about associations, not values. Contingency is about situational factors. Therefore, the answer should be Expectancy theory. Wait, but the options are (A) Expectancy, (B) Instrumental, etc. So the answer is (A) Expectancy.\n",
